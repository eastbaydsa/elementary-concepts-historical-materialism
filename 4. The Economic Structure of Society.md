# The Economic Structure of Society

## Introduction

The previous chapters have given us all the
theoretical elements necessary to understand the
Marxist concept of economic structure. Nevertheless,
we shall not begin with Marx's work but
rather end up there. We will start with a
critique on a definition of economics which
reflects the way in which bourgeois economists
present the problem.

In the Lalande dictionary, political economy
is defined in the following manner:

> A science whose object is the understanding
  of the phenomena and...the determination of
  the laws which concern the distribution of
  wealth, as well as those of production and
  consumption in as much as these phenomena are
  linked to that of distribution.

In this definition, the preponderance of distribution
over the other aspects of the economic cycle
is clearly accentuated. We will examine each one
of these aspects in order to determine which of
them determines the whole process.

We begin by examining the relationship which
exists between the relations of distribution and
the relations of production.

## Relations of Production and Relations of Distribution

Distribution is the way in which the total
social product is divided among the different
members of society.
We will call the total social product the
entirety of goods produced in one year. Let us
suppose that a capitalist society produces in one
year a total social product equivalent to 100
million dollars.

Of this quantity, the capitalists and landlords
receive a much larger part than the workers
and employees.

We could imagine a division of the
\$100,000,000 in the following manner:

--------------------- ----------
Capitalists           30 million
Landlords             20 million
Workers and Employees 50 million
--------------------- ----------

The capitalists and landlords, who constitute
a small group of individuals within society, in
this example receive half of the total social
product.

Therefore the following question arises: Why
do the capitalists and landlords receive such a
large part of the social product when they are
just the ones who do the least work?

Why are there people who have enormous cars
and two or three houses when, on the other hand,
there exist people with nothing?

Is it because the capitalists and owners are
more intelligent, better endowed, or harder
working than the workers and peasants?

It is Marx's great merit to have demonstrated,
through his study of the capitalist mode of production,
that unequal distribution does not depend
on the greater or lesser endowment of human capability,
but rather it depends fundamentally on the
ownership or lack of ownership that individuals
have over the means of production. It must be
that the capitalists are the owners of the
industrial means of production and the landlords
are the owners of the land, that they are able to
appropriate the major part of the social product.

The struggle of workers for better wages is
basically a struggle for a better distribution of
the social product. But while the means of production
are private property in the hands of a
small group of individuals in society, this group
will oppose a more just distribution; it will only
make small concessions in order to calm the
workers' protests.

The distribution of the social product
depends, therefore, on a previous distribution of
the means of production. It is the way in which
the means of production (elements of the process
of production) have been distributed which fundamentally
determines the way in which the social
product will be distributed. To affirm this is to
state that the relations of distribution are
determined by the relations of production. This
is what Marx says in the following text:

> Let us moreover consider the so-called distribution
  relations themselves. The wage
  presupposes wage labor, and profit-capital.
  These definite forms of distribution thus
  presuppose definite social characteristics of
  production conditions, and definite social
  relations of production agents. The specific
  distribution relations are thus merely the
  expression of the specific historical production
  relations. (*Capital* 7,, Vol. II I, p. 882)

And later, on the following page:
> The so-called distribution relations, then,
  correspond to and arise from historically
  determined specific social forms of the process
  of production... (Ibid., p. 883)

## Relations of Production and Relations of Consumption
Consumption is understood to mean the act of
using an object to satisfy a determined need. In
this we do not mean only the consumption of food,
but also the consumption of cars, radios, etc.

If we look at the whole society, we see that
not all the objects produced in the production
process are consumed directly by individuals. For
example, tractors, sewing machines, all the products
of the extractive industries in general,
etc.

These products are not consumed directly but
are used as means of production in other production
processes.

Thus, two types of consumption can be
distinguished:

a. **Individual Consumption.**
    Direct consumption of use value by individuals in
    the society. Examples: food, clothing, automobiles,
    etc.
b. **Productive Consumption.**
    Here, use values are not consumed directly by
    individuals of the society, but rather they intervene
    in new production processes as means of production.
    They are consumed productively; that is,
    they are used in the production of new use values.
    For example, tractors are consumed in agricultural
    production.

*What is called individual, consumption is the direct consumption of use value by the individual.*

*What is called productive consumption is the consumption of use values as means of production.*

At this point, we can see that it is by
beginning with production that we are able to
define the different types of consumption. We
will now examine the role of production in individual
consumption.

1. Production supplies to consumption its
object. Consumption without an object is not consumption.
How does one consume an auto if it has not been produced.
2. Since the product is not an object in
general but a particular object which must be consumed
in a determined way, the object of consumption
also imposes; therefore, the form of consumption.
The act of consuming a car, for
example, implies a knowledge of how to drive it,
etc.
3. Production not only supplies the object
of consumption and determines its form, but it
also continually creates new consumption needs.
If we observe contemporary capitalist society, we
see how producers of merchandise exert a great
deal of effort through advertising to create new
needs. The change in fashion is one of the most
notorious examples. In summary, production produces:
the object of consumption, the form of
consumption, and the consumption instinct.

But the relationship between production and
consumption is not unilateral. Consumption also
has a role in production. If the objects produced
are not consumed, a paralysis of production
results. It is consumption which creates the
necessity of new production.

## Relations of Production and Relations of Exchange
The necessity for exchange arises from the
division of labor. When a man does not produce
all the objects necessary for survival, he must
exchange his surplus products for other needed
products.

The exchange of products is a phenomenon that
is intermediate between production and
distribution.

The intensity, extent, and form of exchange
are determined through the relations of production.
Limited exchange corresponds to limited
production. Private exchange corresponds to private
production, etc.

## The Determinant Role of the Relations of Production

After analyzing the different relations that
are produced within the economic process, we
arrive at the conclusion that the relations of
production constitute the determinant element. As
Marx put it:

> A distinct mode of production thus determines
> the specific mode of consumption, distribution,
> exchange and the specific *relations of
> these different phases to one another*. Production
> *in the narrow sense*, however, is, in
> its turn, also determined by other aspects...there
> is an interaction between the
> various aspects. Such interaction takes
> place in any organic entity.
>
> *Introduction to a Critique of Political Eaonomy*, Progress
> Publishers, Moscow, 1970, p. 205.

It is this determinant character of the relations
of production that explains why Marx would
have these relations intervene exclusively in the
definition of the economic level.

Let us see how Marx defines this level. In
Volume III of *Capital*, in the chapter on the
trinity formula, he says:

> For the aggregate of these relations, in
> which the agents of this production stand
> with respect to nature and to one another,
> ...is precisely society, considered from the
> standpoint of its economic structure.
> (Capital, Vol III, p. 818)

In this text, he is referring both to the
technical relations (agents/nature) and to the
social relations of production (agents/agents).

Also, the text of the *Preface to the Critique
of Political Economy* confirms this definition:

> In the social production of their existence,
> men inevitably enter into definite relations,
> which are independent of their will,
> namely, relations of production appropriate
> to a given stage in the development of their
> material force$ of production. The totality
> of these relations of production constitutes
> the economic strcture of society 
> (*Op. cit., p. 29*)

But this text not only confirms the definition
of the economic structure as the totality of
the relations of production of a given society, it
also adds something else of importance: the
material base on which are established these
relations of production, that is, the degree of
development of the productive forces. This is
important in order to understand the dynamic
character of the economic structure which is *at
the same time a structure and a process*.

Until now we have seen that the relations of
production define the economic level according to
Marx, and that these relations are conditioned by
the forces of production, and that Marx employs
the concept of *structure* to account for its
specific form of combination in the different
historical epochs.

But what does Marxism mean by structures?

## The Economic Structure and the Marxist Concept of  Structure

In developing the Marxist concept of structure,
we will try to arrive at an explanation of
why Marx does not take into account, in order to
define the economy, the other aspects of the
economic cycle: distribution, exchange, and consumption
as do most other definitions.

We should begin by differentiating two concepts:
the concept of totality and the concept of
structure.

The concept of totality is a very broad
notion which is commonly applied in an undifferentiated
way to any conjunction of elements from
the simplest to the most complex like society
itself.

In a strict sense, we define as a totality
that "whole" which is formed by the conjunction of·
juxtaposed elements which have no specific form.
For example, a bag of sugar. This "whole" is
formed by a certain quantity of tiny sugar
crystals, which will take the form of its container,
and without the change of location within
the totality affecting any individual crystal.

The concept of structure, on the other hand,
refers to a "whole" in which the elements are not
juxtaposed, but on the contrary, are distributed
according to the organization of the entirety. It
is this organization which determines the function
each element fulfills within the totality.

The following diagram should permit a better
understanding of what we mean:

The elements that are combined are a circle
and four line segments. In the first structure,
the four line segments form a square in the center
of the figure; in the second, the two upper segments
represent the eyes, the one in the center
represents the nose, and the lower one the mouth.

Here, we see clearly that the same elements play a
different role according to the organization of
the whole and the place they occupy in it.
This is what Marx means when he writes,
referring to the elements which form a part of the
labor process:

> ...that whether a use-value is to be
  regarded as raw material, as instrument of
  labor, or as product, this is determined
  entirely by its function in the labor process,
  by the position it there occupies: as
  this varies, so does its character. (*Capital*,
  Vol. I, p. 178)

Nevertheless, the concept of structure in
Marx goes beyond a simple organization of the
elements in a whole which has been analyzed up to
now.

What is fundamental in the Marxist concept of
structure is the kind of relation which is established
among the different elements of the whole.
It is not the relation of one isolated element to
the whole but the different relations that are
established among the elements which determine, in
the last instance, the type of organization of the
whole. Already we have seen how the different
elements of the labor process combine in two
fundamental relations: the technical relations
and the social relations of production.

These relations which articulate, in a determined
manner, the distinct elements of the labor
process, have a relatively stable character. The
elements may change, but if the relations are
maintained we can speak of the same structure. We
can recall the case of manufacture. In this case,
the structure was characterized by a combination
of capitalist social relations of production
(capitalist/wage laborer) and by technical relations
in which the collective worker was formed
through a combination of detail workers in such a
way that their relation with the instruments of
labor still formed an inseparable unity. While
these relations existed, one had to speak of manufacture,
although the kind of specialized labor
and its number might also change (hammers, looms,
hoes, etc.), and although the kind of specialized
labor and its number might also change.

This structure only changes when the relations
among the elements change with the introduction
of the machine-tool. The relation of unity
between the worker and means of labor is broken
and a new unity is constituted between the means
of labor and the object of labor which, in turn,
determines a change of character in the collective
worker who becomes specialized.

These relations are not visible at first
sight. Any superficial observer would say that
the difference between manufacture and large
industry is limited to the greater degree of technical
development of the instruments of labor.

They are so difficult to see that they can
only be brought to light by a serious scientific
labor. We have already said that many writers
before Marx had referred to the situation of
exploitation of the working class under capitalism,
but no one before him was capable of
describing the profound relations which are the
origin of that exploitation. The effects of the
capitalist system were described, but its structure
and internal relations remained unknown.

Finally, the concept of structure in Marx *is
inseparable from the concept of process*. When
Marx studied manufacture at the same time that he
studied the relations of production which characterize
it as such, he also studied the way in
which, through the internal contradictions appropriate
to that structure, the conditions were
being prepared so that the highly specialized
labor of the detail worker was transformed into
the detail labor of a machine-tool. He showed,
at the same time, how the physical, organic limit,
implied by the unity of the detail worker and the
means of labor, falls into contradiction with the
drive of the capitalist for profits.

We would say that what Marx did in *Capital*,
in general, was not a *structural analysis* of the
capitalist mode of production which accents stable
relations but, on the contrary, a dynamic analysis
of development of this mode of production, of its
internal contradictions, of the conditions for its
disappearance. But, although we put the emphasis
on the process, this process can only be studied
beginning with its fundamental structural relations,
which determine what is specific to this
process and what differentiates it from any other
process.

From what has been said above, we can define
the concept of structure in the following way:

> We call an articulated totality composed of a
conjunction of internal and stable relations
which determine the function which the
elements perform within this totality, a
structure[^4.1].

Finally, it seems important to us to introduce
a new concept to account for the complete
economic cycle: production, distribution,
exchange, and consumption.

For that we will begin by defining.what we
mean by organisation. An organization is.also an
articulated totality, but of visible elements.
When the organization of these elements follows a
determined internal order, when it is subject to a
specific hierarchy, we call it a *system*.

It is in this sense that we refer to the economic system of a determined society. When we speak of an economic system, we are including in the concept all the phases of the economic cycle.

Therefore, we will distinguish between two concepts: economic structure and economic system.

*We call the conjunction of relations of production the **economic structure**. We call the complete economic process (production, distribution, exchange, and consumption) the **economic system**.*

[^4.1]: The concept of structure and the relation between the Marxist concept of structure and structuralism will be amply developed in the book *The Fundamental Problems of Dialectical Materialism*, now in preparation.
  For now, we only want to advance, following Althusser in his unpublished text, that "all structure in Marx must be understood as process" and that the failure to sufficiently point out this fundamental aspect of the Marxist concept of structure has led to the charge that the Althusserian trend presents a structuralist interpretation of Marx.

  However, contrary to structuralism, the Marxist concept of structure has nothing to do with a simple "combination" of relations. The social structure is not, according to Marxist thought, a simple combination of relations which could be constructed independently of concrete history, on the one hand, and, on the other, Marxism recognizes a certain hierarchy in these relations. There exist dominant relations and relations which have a determinant role in the final instance. As Althusser says, it is a question of a "structure in dominance," determined in the final instance by the economic relations.

  Neither is it proper to separate synchrony and diachrony. It is only a question of two points of view. When the stable character of these relations is emphasized and they are studied as such, this is thinking from the synchronic point of view. But this same structure, perceived as a process, implies putting into practice a diachronic point of view.

## Summary

In this chapter, we have begun by examining
the existing relations between distribution, consumption,
exchange, and production in order to
arrive at a definition of economic structure as
the conjunction of relations of production. In
order to clarify this concept, we have needed to
dwell on the Marxist concept of structure.

We have seen here the following concepts of
historical materialism: 

- economic structure
- productive consumption
- individual consumption.

10. What is meant by economic structure?
11. What is meant by economic system?

### Themes for reflection
1. Why is-the notion of "industrial societies,"
which is used to designate the United States
as well as the Soviet Union, not a Marxist
concept? What are the implications of its
use?
2. Can a restructuring of incomes be realized
without changing the existing relations of
production? In this case, we mean a restructuring
of income that is in accord with the
interests of the workers.
