# Productive forces

## The Productive Forces

In the previous chapters, we have studied the elements of the labor process,
and we have seen that the means of labor are the determinant elements of
this process, those which determine the form that production takes and, therefore,
the kind of technical relations which can be established between the
workers and the means of production. We have seen, moreover, how these technical
relations are over-determined by the social relations of production. And
all this has helped us to understand one of the basic concepts of Marxism, the
concept of *relations of production*.

Marx tells us in the preface to the *Critique of Political Economy*:

> In the social production of their existence, men invariably enter
  into definite relations, which are independent of their will,
  namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the
  development of their material *forces of production*... At a
  certain stage of development, the material productive forces of
  society come into conflict with the existing relations of
  production. (Progress Publishers, 1970, pp. 20-1)

What do we mean, then, by productive forces?

The productive forces are apparently no more than the elements of the
labor process considered from the point of view of their productive potential,
especially power[^3.1] and the means of labor [^3.2].

Nevertheless, to understand the productive forces as such, it is not
possible to examine the elements of the labor process in isolation.
When Marx studies manufacture, for example, he shows us how the technical
division of labor and the forms of collective labor established therein not
only augment the individual productive forces but also produce new productive
forces which are not limited to being a simple sum of the forces combined
there.

The simple fact that the workers work in a common place, although only
under simple forms of cooperation, augments the productivity of labor power
by developing the spirit of competition among the different workers. Later,
when forms of complex cooperation are established, the specialization of the
workers into different tasks and the coordination of these tasks into a single
collective worker produces a notable increase in the productive forces of most
groups of workers. The difference between the sum of the individual productive
forces and the productive force of the collective worker is greater and
greater. Thus is born a *new* productive force which, under capitalist conditions
of production, becomes the property of the capitalist without his having
to pay the slightest amount of money for it.

From what has been said above, we can understand why we maintain that to
understand the real productive forces we cannot consider the elements isolated
from one another.

The decisive factor in lending the potential productive elements a real
productivity is the labor power of man. He is the only one who can put the
means of production into action. Without human labor, the means of production
have only a potentially productive character. For this reason, Marx, in considering
the development of the productive forces, conceives of the way in
which the productivity of human labor is increased in terms of the utilization
of this or that means of production.

From the above, we conclude that it is necessary to distinguish between
*potential productive forces*, which would be the elements of the labor process
seen as isolated from one another, and productive forces as such, which arise
from a historically determined combination of these elements.

We believe that it is in this sense that the following text of Marx can
be interpreted:

>Whatever the social forms of production, laborers and the means of
  production always remain factors of it. But in a state of separation
  from each other either of these *factors* can be such only *potentially*.
  For production to go on they must unite. *The specific manner in
  which this union is accomplished distinguishes the different
  economic epochs of the structure of society from one another[^3.3].*

These different combinations produce different productive results, which
can be measured by the level of productivity of labor[^3.4].

The productive forces of a society grow, develop, and are perfected in
the course of history. And this development is determined, fundamentally, by
the level of development of the means of labor.

The advance from stone implements to iron ones permits for example, an
important increase in the productivity of labor of primitive peoples, thus
increasing the development of the productive forces.

The same thing
happens with the introduction of machine tools in capitalist production.
From
that moment the development of the productive forces
grows at a dizzying
pace.

It is important to point out that the rhythm and character of this
development of the productive forces depends directly on the nature of the
relations of production under which the labor process develops.

It is the capitalist form of accumulation in the pre-monopoly stage which
produces the massive integration of machine tools in the production process,
thus giving a great impulse to the development of the productive forces in
this mode of production.

Nevertheless, the same process of accumulation is what, later, in the
monopoly stage, tends to brake the development of the productive forces, as we
shall see later.

The development of the productive forces is, therefore, neither linear
nor cumulative; it is a development which depends on the structure of the production
process: on the relations of the agents among themselves and of the
agents to the means of production, that is, on the relations of production.

How then are the affirmations of Marx as to the determinant character of
the relationship which the productive forces have over the relations of production
to be understood? By saying that it is these latter relations which
determine the rhythm and form of the development of the productive forces are
we not denying what Marx asserted?

We think not. We think that when Marx, Engels, and Lenin use the words
base, root, conditions sine qua non, support etc., to explain the relation
that exists between the productive forces and the relations of production,
what they are doing is pointing out the determinant role which the development
of the means of labor has in the creation of certain material conditions which
make possible the establishment of determined relations of production.

Thus, we understand better and better the Marx text which affirms that
the instruments of labor indicate on the one hand the level of development of
man's labor power, and on the other the social conditions in which he works.

*They [the instruments] indicate the level of development of man's labor
power* because the productivity of his labor depends fundamentally on the means
of labor which he utilizes. The level of labor productivity carried out with
a tractor cannot be compared to the labor realized by a cart drawn by oxen.

*They* indicate the social conditions of labor because the technical characteristics
of the instruments of labor determine the specific structure of the
labor process, on which specific relations of production are based. We have
already seen, in the previous chapter, how the introduction of machine tools
produces a very important change in the structure of the labor process which
is characterized, on the one hand by the conversion of the labor process into
a highly socialized one in which collective labor fulfills a technical need
and, on the other hand, by the conversion of the worker into an individual
absolutely separate from the means of production, since in addition to not
owning the latter, he has lost all dominion over them. This technical relation
serves as a support for the capitalist social relations of production.

Both relations as we shall see further on, will come into contradiction with
the nature of the productive forces, that is, with the increasingly more
socialized structure of the labor process within the whole of production and
with the increasingly greater interdependence of the different sectors of
production.

Before studying what is meant by the increasingly social character of the
productive forces whereby we shall be able to better develop what is meant by
the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production,
let us define some concepts.

***Potential productive forces*** are the elements of the labor process, when
considered apart from it, from the point of view of their productive potential.
Productive forces proper are the *forces* which result from the combination
of the elements of the labor process under specific relations of production.
The result is a given productivity of labor[^3.5].

*The level of development of the productive forces is measured by the level
of productivity of labor.*

## The Socialization of the Productive Forces

As we have already seen, the productive forces are, except
exceptions, constantly developing. This process of development
itself, beginning with individual production, into a process of
more and more social.

The production of an artisan which is an individual production process is
surpassed by industrial production in which the production process has a social
character. The means of production can only be set in motion by a group of
workers and, hence, none of them can say that the product of his specialized
labor is *his product*. Production is transformed from a series of individual
acts into a series of social acts, and the products from individual to social
products.

The ever more social character of the productive forces cannot be reduced
to the socialization of the labor process within the factory as some Marxist
texts seem to suggest.

The socialization of the productive forces overflows the boundary of the
factory. It depends principally on two factors: 

a. The evermore social
origin of the means of production, and
b. the ever more social destination of the product.

### The Ever More Social Origin of the Means of Production[^3.6]

The ever more social origin of the means of production is understood to
express the fact that those means of production come from an ever greater
number of branches of economic production. Thus, primitive agriculture, for
example, is self-sufficient, that is, the number.of means of production of
non-agricultural origin that it uses is very limited. But agriculture
progressively requires for its own production means of production whose origin
is more and more diverse: more complex tools, disinfectants, electrical
energy, electrical equipment etc. The same happens in each branch of industry,
whether it extracts raw materials or manufactures secondary products.

The growing socialization of the productive forces, therefore, manifests
itself in the fact that each branch of production needs means of production
whose origins are increasingly diverse. This process is the counterpart of
the greater division of labor and the growing specialization of economic
activity.

### The Ever More Social Destination of the Product[^3.7]

The ever more social destination of the product is understood to express
the fact that the products which are the result of a production are destined
generally, either directly or indirectly, for a growing number of users.

This phenomenon has diverse implications, especially the following:

1. Each branch of production works directly or indirectly for a growing number
   of other branches. This is merely the other side of the growing division of
   social labor, Thus, for example, the chemical industry, which when it appears
   for he first time as a distinct sector of production only works for a small
   number of industries, progressively extends the range of applications and uses
   of its products. Presently, the range of applications for the products of the
   chemical industry is almost infinite. It extends to agriculture, to extractive
   industries, to metallurgical industries (especially in the treatment of
   metals), etc. If we take into account the indirect uses, it appears that
   currently each branch of production works for every other branch and, therefore,
   also experiences the repercussions of all the variations which can occur
   in any sector of the economy.

2. The ever more social destination of the product is also manifested in
   another form, if we examine the dimensions of the whole system which is served
   by one unit of the product. With the progress of the productive forces, these
   dimensions are generally (although not necessarily) growing. Thus, we pass
   successively from the local, to the micro-regional, to the regional, then
   national, then international level.

The necessity of state ownership of certain means of production is so
much the stronger as these means are utilized more in activities (or economic
units) more highly integrated in the social division of labor, set in action
in it whether because of the very nature of the means of production or because
of the destination of their products.

In summary, the socialization of the productive forces is not limited
only to what happens within the factory but refers fundamentally to the
growing interdependence of the different sectors of the national and worldwide
economy.

***The socialization of the productive forces*** *is the ever more socialized
character of the labor process in a given production process and the ever
greater interdependence existing be-tween several sectors of social
production[^3.8].*

Each capitalist depends more and more on all other capitalists. This was
not the case of the small, isolated industries working for a very limited
market. If one of them stopped, it only provoked a local disturbance. On the
contrary, a stoppage in a grand enterprise devoted to a very specialized
industry can provoke an upheaval throughout the society.

On the other hand, it is the growing socialization of the productive
forces of the society which has brought even those countries ruled by the laws
of the capitalist system of production to recognize the urgent necessity to
plan their economy and to transform *into state property* those sectors which
are basic to the progress of the global economy.

The ever more social character of the productive forces comes into
increasingly acute contradiction[^3.9], with the private nature of capitalist
appropriation of the means of production.

We say that it comes into increasingly acute contradiction, not that it
gives rise to contradiction since, from the beginning of the capitalist mode
of production, a contradictory unity has existed between the private character
of capitalist ownership of the means of production and the social character
which labor power has had since its beginning, a contradiction that did not
exist in the era of artisan production. Precisely this contradiction has been
the principal impulse to the development of the productive forces in the first
stages of capitalist development. The capitalist driven by the desire for
profit and having united under his command a certain number of workers and
stimulated thus the development of the productive forces, has continually
sought to obtain greater profits: first by specializing the workers to the
maximum point, then by introducing machinery.

But, to the degree that the productive forces develop, especially to the
degree that the instrument of labor is perfected, the machine, too, continues
to socialize the collective worker within the factory and, at the same time, continues
to intertwine different sectors of production, to the point where
the contradiction is transformed from the motor force for the development of
the productive forces into the brake. This contradiction, then, takes on an
antagonistic character, thus preparing the material conditions for the destruction
of the capitalist relations of production.

The classic Marxist-Leninist text treats this antagonistic contradiction
as the non-correspondence between the development of the productive forces and
the existing relations of production. Now let us look at the classic Marxist
theses in respect to this problem.

## The Correspondence and Non-Correspondence of the Productive Forces and the Relations of Production
\sectionmark{Correspondence and Non-Correspondence}

Marxism maintains that the productive forces and the relations of production
develop unevenly. In general, the development of the productive force is
constant (although periods of stagnation can exist). On the contrary, the
relations of production do not change everyday, and they tend therefore to
be left behind in relation to the development of the productive forces. Bit
by bit, a non-correspondence emerges, the relations of production begin to be
inadequate for the expansion of the productive forces, they begin to block and
to brake their own development; an example of this non-correspondence is the
monopoly-capitalist system, in which the productive forces, which have reached
a high level of socialization, in contradiction to the private character of
property relations.

On the other hand, the development of the productive forces.is abetted
and stimulated when the social relations of production correspond to the level
of development of the productive forces. This is called the **law of correspondence**
between the productive forces and the relations of production.

This idea of correspondence is frequently employed by Marx and Engels.
In the Preface to the *Critique of Political Economy*, Marx writes:

> In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into
  definite relations which are independent of their will, namely relations of
  production which correspond to a given stage in the development of their
  material forces of production.

It is important to dwell on this notion of correspondence since it forestalls
the establishment of a one-sided relation: the productive forces lead
to the relations of production, and vice versa. That is, it keeps us from
thinking of the relations between the productive forces and the relations of
production as relations of cause and effect.

The relations of production, as we have seen, are not the simple effect
of the productive forces. For example, *capital* makes us see that the establishment
of capitalist manufacture in the heart of feudal society was not produced
solely as the simple effect of the division of social labor nor of the
perfection of the instruments of production. The participation of an element
external to the productive forces was also necessary: the accumulation of a
certain quantity of capital in the hands of a certain group of people. The
establishment of the capitalist system of production requires what Marx
called **primitive accumulation**. This is not explained by the development of
the productive forces alone. The productive forces are, therefore, only
determinant in the last instance. It is important that we not forget the
phrase "in the last instance" because it serves to establish a line of
demarcation between *mechanical determination* in which the determined element
is the simple effect of the dominant element, or cause, and this *different
kind of determination* takes place within a complex structure in which the other
elements of the structure act, in turn, on the determinant element in the last
instance.

Thus, the expression "determination in the last instance" does not resolve
the theoretical problem. It has a negative utility, it rejects mechanical
determinism, but what is its positive content? It would seem to be that of
indicating the material limits within which given relations of production can
be established.

There is no kind of exploitation which can be established in a social
group before a surplus product exists.

Socialist relations of production cannot be established before the
existence of a significant level of socialization of the productive forces.

Therefore, in studying the kinds of determination realized by the productive
forces it is necessary to avoid two important errors: *mechanistic
determinism* supports the idea that the socialization of productive forces will
bring as its inevitable result the establishment of socialist relations of
production, and corollary to that, there is nothing more to be done than to
wait for this to take place spontaneously.

The second error consists in the *underestimation of the minimal limits
necessary to establish socialist relations of production*. If we cannot expect
the conditions to be absolutely mature for the establishment of socialist
relations of production, neither can these relations be instituted by political
decision. For example, to oblige peasants who are tied to their land and who
cultivate it individually and with very rudimentary instruments to work
collectively is to impose an idealistic measure unrelated to any necessary
minimal material conditions. On the other hand, the introduction of tractors
and other agricultural machines makes the peasants understand, through new
working conditions, the necessity of collective labor and, thus, socialist
relations of production might be established on a firm base. In this respect,
it is interesting to study how the revolution in China and Vietnam has learned
how to conduct the changes in the countryside all the way to the establishment
of socialist relations of production, without forcing the peasants to accept
decisions by higher governmental agencies.

## The Role of Science in the Development of the Productive Forces
\sectionmark{The Role of Science}

We refer, finally, to the question of the relation between science and
the productive forces, since science occupies an ever more important role in
the present world.

Some theoreticians of the Second International sought *the* final or determinant
cause of the development of the productive forces in the progress of
knowledge, and in the advances of science. This was Kautsky's outlook, for
example.

It is obvious that the progress of science, and especially the natural
sciences, has exercised an important influence over the development of the
productive forces and in particular over the development of technology.
Contemporary large-scale industry would be impossible without the application of
modern scientific discoveries in the fields of mechanics, physics, and
chemistry. Modern, large-scale agriculture is based on the application of
chemistry, and of agro-biology, etc.

But, although scientific knowledge plays a very important role in the
development of the productive forces, it would be incorrect to seek the fundamental
and determinant cause of this development there.

The development of science depends on the form in which a given society
produces its material wealth.

In a letter to Starkenburg, on the 25th of January, 1884, Engels wrote:

> If, as you say, technique largely depends on the state of science,
  science depends far more still on the state and requirements of
  technique. If society has a technical need, that helps science forward
  more than ten universities. The whole of hydrostatics
  (Toricell, etc.) was called forth by the necessity for regulating
  the mountain streams of Italy in the sixteenth and seventeenth
  centuries. We have only known anything reasonable about electricity
  since its technical applicability was discovered. But unfortunately
  it has become the custom in Germany to write the history of the
  sciences as if they had fallen from the skies[^3.10].

The economic and social conditions of production determine not only the
acquisition of certain scientific discoveries, but also their application.

For example, the property of steam as a source of energy had already been
discovered in ancient Greece. But at that time the existence of slavery made
the utilization of that discovery unnecessary, since it was possible to take
advantage of the large quantity of manual labor available.

The capitalist laws of competition represent, in contrast, an enormous
stimulus for the development of technology and, consequently, of science as
well. New machines with a greater output are constantly needed in order to
produce at lower and lower costs, and in this way to conquer the market. The
situation changes when capitalism becomes transformed into monopoly capitalism.
The monopolies corner the inventions' patents to prevent their falling into
the hands of competitors. Only an infinitesimal portion of them is ever
utilized. An example of the braking effect of monopoly capitalism on the
development of science and its application to production is the case of atomic
energy. The capitalist monopolies have put up great resistance to the peaceful
development of atomic energy.

Summing up, scientific discoveries only create the possibility for the
development of the productive forces, but they are dependent on the social
relations of production for their realization, that is to say, for the application
of scientific discoveries in production.

## Summary

In this chapter, we have defined what we mean by productive forces and
what it means to say that the productive forces determine in the last
instance the relations of production, although it is the latter which itself
determines the rhythm and nature of the development of the productive forces.

We have explained what is meant by the socialization of the productive
forces and how this socialization comes into contradiction with capitalist
relations of production. We have expounded upon the manner in which the
classics pose the correspondence and non-correspondence between the productive
forces and the relations of production, applying to the fullest extent the
terms correspondence and determination in the last instance. Finally, we have
briefly looked at the relation between scientific development and the development
of the productive forces.

We have had before us the following general concepts of historical
materialism in this chapter:

- Productive forces
- Socialization of the productive
forces
- Determination in the last instance

[^3.1]: In this process (of labor), man as a natural power confronts the material
    of nature. [Man] puts into action the *natural forces* which form his body-being,
    his arms and legs, head and hands, in order to in this way
    assimilate, in a way useful for his existence, the materials that nature
    offers him. Marx, *Capital*, Vol. I (italics by Marta Harnecker). In a
    letter of Annenkov, Marx speaks of "productive faculties of man"
    (December 28, 1846).
[^3.2]: In the chapter about large industry, Marx speaks of the productivity of
    the machine and says that it can be measured comparative to the productivity
    of the human labor force.
[^3.3]: Marx, Capital, Vol. II, pp. 36-7 (Marta Harnecker' s italics).
[^3.4]: That is to say, the number of products that can be produced in a determined amount of time.
[^3.5]: We must not confuse the *forces of production* with the *character* or *nature
      of these forces*. For example, a determined force may have a mechanical
      or human character depending on where its impetus comes from or it could
      be from a mixture of the two. Nevertheless, as the forces of production
      are whichever ones arise from the combination of the elements of the
      labor process in a determined production process, it is the specific
      type of combination that determines the nature or character of a force of
      production. This could be individual in the case of artisan production
      or social in the case of a cooperative system. But the social character
      lends specific characteristics to manufacturing and to large industry: a
      workers collective formed by parcel (packing) workers in manufacturing
      and the collective socialized worker in large industry. What's more, the
      social character extends to the interrelationship between diverse sectors
      of production, as we will see in the following point. It is this
      *character*, which the forces of production take in each concrete production
      process, that enters into contradiction with the character of the
      production relations.
[^3.6]: This point is a textual translation from the text of Professor Bettelheim:

    sociale," which appeared in the journal *Etudes de Planification
    Socialiste*, 1-2, p. 23.
