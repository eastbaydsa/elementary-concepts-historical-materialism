# Surplus Value

## Value in the Simple Commodity Economy

In this appendix[^sv.190], we've endeavored to present the concept of surplus value
both clearly and rigorously. It is only through this concept that we can make it
clear to ourselves the causes of capitalist exploitation in a scientific way, and
therefore see what must be done to eliminate them.

In creating this appendix, we have intended it principally to be useful to
working comrades. Hopefully we've achieved this objective.

[^sv.190]: In writing this appendix we've used -- in addition to Marx's *Capital* -- the text of Lapidus and
Ostrovitianov: *Manual of Political Economy* (Moscow, 1929). We strongly recommend their reading for its
great simplicity without sacrificing scientific rigor. This text will be published in *Editorial Universitaria*,
from Santiago, Chile, under the title of *Conceptos fundamentales de El Capital de Carlos Marx*, with a
presentation of ours and a plan for studying *Capital*.

### The division of labor and private property: the main preconditions of an economic system based on exchange

In the most remote places of Latin America, we still find groups of people, the greater part being indigenous,
who satisfy their basic needs only through their own activity:
they make their bread with the wheat which they planted themselves, they dress themselves with fabric
woven by hand with the wool of their sheep, they build their houses with the wood of the forests and
mud from the area they live in, etc.

This is in complete contrast with the scene of the great Latin-American cities.
In them, no one can satisfy their needs without turning to many others: their food,
their house, their clothes, depend on the labor of many other people.

In these great cities, each person has their specific work: metalworker,
textile worker, bakery worker, etc. And therefore, one can one live by
by being connected in some way to the other workers who go on providing
the things which one does not produce, but which one needs to live.

In the great cities there therefore exists, on the one hand, a great division
of labor[^sv.191], and on the other hand, a great interdependence between the
workers who work in the different branches.

As the division of labor develops, the interdependence of the different sectors
grows.[^sv.192]

[^sv.191]: The division of social production grows along with the technical division of labor. See these concepts in chapter 1.

[^sv.192]: See the concept on the socialization of the productive forces in chapter 3.

But how is the connection between the different lines of work achieved in capitalist
society?

In capitalist society, where businesses belong to individual capitalists,
where the capitalists are owners of their businesses and organize them
in accordance with their own interests and not with those of society,
the connection between different lines of work, or between different
businesses, cannot be achieved through a global planning of the society's
economy (through a single management which would organize production and the distribution of goods),
but only through the exchange of products on the market.

Therefore, when you have private ownership of the means of production, the only
form of relating the different isolated economic units is through exchange of
products on the market.

In economies in which exchange predominates, each isolated producer (or group of
producers) produces not to satisfy their own needs, but to sell their products in
the market and thereby to buy the products which they need to live.

These products, which are use-values for others in the market, are called
*commodities* by Marx.

Now then, it is important to clarify that basing the economy on exchange is
not only a feature of the capitalist regime of production, but can be found
in different regimes of production. During slavery for example, the objects
produced by a group of slaves on a plantation (*hacienda*) were exchanged
by objects produced by other groups of slaves or by small artisans.

What is the difference between a simple commodity economy and the capitalist economy?

A commodity economy is characterized by the fact that the producer of
the commodity is at the same time its owner and has the right to dispose of it as they like.
In the capitalist economy, the direct producers -- the workers -- are not the owners of
the commodities they produce, which belong to the factory-owners, the owners of the means of
production, who force the workers (who have neither means of production nor means of consumption)
to work for them.

### Price, the apparent regulator of the exchange-based economy

Now then, although the final objective of this appendix is to understand the
capitalist system of exploitation more deeply, we will need to start by analyzing
the features of the simple commodity economy, as only then will we later be able to
fulfill our final objective in the easiest way possible.

In every simple commodity economy, as in all economies based on exchange, the
possessors of commodities appear in the market as equal owners of their commodities
and do not part with them unless they receive others in exchange.

Now then, as individual owners of their commodities, they pursue individual
ends, always seeking to sell for the highest price possible.

But can the individual owners satisfy their desire to sell as dearly
as possible?

Although the individual owner seems to be the lord and master of their
commodities (and they can do whatever they want with them), whether
their will is carried out is not up to him.

The buyer is also an owner, who has money and who wants to buy at
the lowest possible price. Moreover, next to our seller of
commodities stand many others, and it may happen that there are
fewer buyers than sellers, leaving the merchants at risk of not
selling all their goods.

This gives rise to competition between the owners of the commodities.
They begin to fight against each other, competing for buyers and
trying to sell at a lower price than their rivals.

In this way, the market becomes the scene of a double fight between
the sellers and the buyers on the one hand, and amongst the sellers
themselves on the other.

When the producer goes to the market with their commodities, they do
not know if they have produced too much or too little, nor do they
know how popular their goods will be. Only through the price which
their commodity obtains in the market are they made aware of the importance
that it has within social production.

If, for example, the price of shoes goes way up, that means that
fewer shoes were produced than are necessary to meet the needs of
buyers. If, conversely, the price of shoes falls, that means that
more shoes than necessary were produced.

Individual producers will take into account these signals that the
market sends them. In the first case, they'll produce more shoes, and in the second case, 
fewer.

In this way, an economy based on exchange finds itself directed and
regulated by the movement of prices. They act as spontaneous regulators
of the economy. The individual commodity producer has no choice but to
submit to this blind law, outside of their control.

But what do prices depend on? What makes one thing worth a certain amount of
money, and another thing a different amount?

Let's see what happens if we go to buy a shirt at a shop. The seller offers
us several kinds of shirts at different prices. If we ask them why one shirt
costs more than another they'll tell us that it's due to the better quality of the
first, and therefore, its longer lifespan.

But can prices be explained by things' better quality and longer lifespans?

Let's see if this is the case when comparing a shirt to another object, for example
to a plate. This object costs much less than a shirt, but no matter whether it's made of
plastic or metal, will last much longer than a shirt.

Perhaps then price depends on the usefulness of a thing?

The following example makes clear that this cannot be the explanation either:
bread is much more useful and necessary to a human being than diamonds, but
diamonds are infinitely more expensive.

Additionally, the utility of a thing is different for each buyer. A worker
who can only buy one pair of pants per year and a lawyer who can buy 
several per year will see the utility of a given pair of pants differently.

Therefore, it is difficult to determine the utility which a given product
has. But, you might say, even if that's not possible, we can still easily
determine instead how many people would want to buy a given object and how many
others would want to sell it.

It's impossible to determine how many more times useful bread is than
shoes, but it is possible to determine how many people came today to buy
size 40 shoes for example. If there are 10 pairs and 20 people came, that
means that demand is greater than supply. If, conversely, there are 20 pairs
and only 10 people came, then supply is greater than demand.

So wouldn't it be through supply and demand that prices are set in the market?

Don't onions go up in price when they're scarce? Isn't fruit more expensive
at the start of the season, and later much cheaper?

We cannot deny that supply and demand influence prices, but does this sufficiently
account for the price of a commodity?

If it did, two things which had the same demand would have the same price.

For example, suppose there are 100 pounds of sugar on the market and the demand
is 50 pounds. Suppose further there are 10 pairs of shows and the demand is only 5.
It's clear that in both cases the demand is 50% of the supply, but that doesn't mean
a pair of shoes will have the same price as a pound of sugar.

The law of supply and demand can explain small fluctuations in price:
why a pound of sugar today is 1,000 pesos more than it was a few days ago,
why shoes are cheaper at the end of the season. But it does not explain why
sugar is worth a certain amount of money -- a certain number of dollars --
and why shoes are worth another amount, calculated not in dollars but in hundreds
of dollars.

Therefore, the law of supply and demand can explain to us the
rise or fall of prices over short periods of time, but it cannot explain
why one commodity costs more than another, or why I can buy many pounds
of sugar with the money with which I could buy only one pair of shoes.

### The cost of production

If a commodity producer has to sell their commodities at a loss
because there are not enough buyers, they'll stop making them and
start making commodities which have a higher demand.

But how do they realize that the production of certain commodities
is no longer advisable?

If we ask a merchant of chairs to lower the price for us, what will they
say? That they can't lower it because it cost them more than the
price we're asking for.

Does that mean that the price of commodities is determined by the cost of
production?

To answer this question let's look at a concrete example: a dressmaker who
makes dresses at home to sell. What is the cost of production of these dresses?

They spend money to buy: fabric, thread, buttons. They spend money
on the rent for the room where they sew, on light and heat, and finally,
for replacing the machine, which wears out with use.
If the sewing machine costs 500 dollars and only lasts to sew 500 dresses,
the dressmaker would have to account for 1 dollar in replacement costs for
each dress in order to be able to replace the machine when it's been used
up.

Now then, is the price of a product determined by the sum of these costs?

If that were so, that would mean that the dressmaker was paid nothing for
their work, and they would die of hunger. If the dressmaker takes a whole
day to make a dress, they must receive for their work an amount of
money which would enable them to buy the commodities which they couldn't
produce while working on the dress, but which they need to live.

To be able to live, they therefore need to exchange the products of
their labor for the products of others' labor.

In this way, the price of the dress must take into account the following
elements:

|Cost (dollars)|Goods purchased|Type|Means of\
production|
|-------|-------|------|-------|
|60|fabric|Raw material|Yes|
|5|buttons|Raw material|Yes|
|5|thread|Raw material|Yes|
|1|wear-and-tear on \
sewing machine|Means of labor|Yes|
|1|electricity|Means of labor|Yes|
|1|heat|Means of labor|Yes|
|1|rent for the room|Means of labor|Yes|
|65|labor of the\
dressmaker|Labor power|No|
|140|**Total**|||

Now, the dressmaker will try to sell the dress for more than it cost
to make. Sometimes they will manage to do so, in those cases when the demand
for dresses is greater than the supply. However, if that does happen,
all of the dressmakers will start making dresses, and later there will be
more dresses on the market than there is demand for, at which point prices
will fall again.

Therefore, we see that there exist changes in price which depend on changes
in supply and demand, but we also see that these changes do not deviate much
from the cost of producing the objects in question.

Can we then say that the price is determined by the cost of producing objects?

No, because if we analyze each of the elements which go into the cost of production,
without counting the labor of the dressmaker, we notice that they can also be reduced
to their own elements. For example, fabric can be reduced to expenditure on wool,
wear-and-tear on looms, etc., plus a certain number of labor hours for the weaver.
It's like this for all the other elements as well. And if we continue reducing what we
just broke down, we will see that it is reduced at last to the labor of the shepherd.

If we reduce each of the elements until the end, we will see that the cost of production
reduces to the labor applied by various workers to goods produced by nature.

### Labor: the basis of value

In the previous sections, we have seen how the price of a commodity can vary
according to supply and demand, but we have also seen that supply and demand
do not explain the number around which prices oscillate.
We have seen that this number is ultimately explained only by the amount of labor
necessary for the creation of the corresponding commodity.

Our analysis has led us, therefore, from the natural properties of
commodities (shoes, plates, diamonds, etc.), from the market and exchange, to
human labor.

Human labor is, therefore, the basis of all social life. Humans need material
objects to satisfy their needs, and these objects do not fall from the sky.
They are the product of the labor of human beings on nature.

But a human being neither lives nor labors alone. They live and labor in society.
In the labor process, people start to depend on each other, and in that way create certain
relations of production between themselves.[^sv.193]

[^sv.193]: See chapter 2.

Thus, the work of an individual becomes a quantum of social labor and
the relations of labor must ensure that the social labor is distributed in
such a way that society as a whole can satisfy its needs. In our discussion
of simple commodity production, we saw how this distribution of social
labor works in that case, through the laws of the market.

We saw, moreover, that prices fluctuate, but that they fluctuate around a
level which is determined in the last instance by the amount of labor 
incorporated in that commodity. We call the level around which prices of
a commodity fluctuate its **value**.

The **law of value** is the law which governs the exchange of commodities.
It holds that the exchange of commodities in the market is governed in
the last instance by the amount of labor incorporated in them. If
one commodity is worth twice as much as another, it is because it contains
twice as much labor.

This law of value is the law which spontaneously regulates commodity economies based on the existence of individual producers who only
enter into relations between each other through the market.
When, one day, society is able to totally plan the economy so that
the distribution of social labor is not done blindly -- through the
market -- but done consciously and planned in advance, the law of
value will disappear; it will no longer make sense.

Now, we have stated that the value of a commodity is determined by the
amount of labor which has been incorporated in it.

Does that mean that the value of a commodity is determined by the individual
labor, and that the commodity would be worth more or less depending on the
efficiency of the individual labor that produced it?

If that were the case, there would be as many values as there are levels of
efficiency in working. If one dressmaker makes a dress in 12 hours, another in
16, and another in 18, there would be 3 values for the dresses.

But let's see what happens if these 3 dressmakers go to sell their dresses in
the market. The one who worked for 18 hours will try to sell it at a price which
will pay for those 18 hours. Now, the others in seeing her try to sell at such
a high price will try to sell at that same price -- earning more money with less
labor. However, what will then happen in the market? Many other dressmakers, attracted
by the high price of dresses, will start making more, but then as there will be
an oversupply of dresses on the market, will find they are forced to lower prices.
Now then, supposing that supply and demand coincide, what price will dresses be
sold for? At the price implied by the largest amount of labor or at the price implied
by the smallest amount of labor?

The value which regulates prices does not depend on an individual labor, but on
the labor performed by the whole society on producing a given product. Value is
not calculated based on the largest amount of labor, or on the smallest, but on
the average amount labor. The work done using an average level of technology and
an average efficiency of labor power.[^sv.izzy]

[^sv.izzy]: Translator's note: this is a simplification which assumes that all value is realized (i.e.,
that no one is forced to take losses) or in other words that the producers on the whole will 
sell all their product and be accurately compensated for their total labor.
Even when supply and demand meet,
this is not true in reality, where extra-economic mechanisms may be applied to pay for less
than the actual price.

The value of a product therefore depends not on individual labor but on the labor socially
necessary to produce it.

We'll give an example:

Let us see how the socially necessary time to produce a given kind of shirt is determined:

|Sewer|Shirts made by each|Total shirts|Time/labor per shirt|Total labor hours|
|-------|-------|------|-------|-------|
|20|20|400|2|800|
|30|10|300|1200|
|60|50|300|1800|
|Total|-|1000|-|3800|

Therefore, producing 1000 shirts that are necessary for society
implies the expenditure of 3800 hours, that is, 3.8 hours per shirt on average ($3800 / 1000 = 3.8$).

This time of 3.8 hours, i.e., 3 hours and 48 minutes, is the socially necessary time.

One shouldn't make the mistake of calculating the socially necessary time by taking
an average of the hours needed in the businesses of the lowest and the highest
efficiency. In that case, the lowest performing businesses produce a shirt every 6 hours
and the highest performing ones every 2 hours. The average would be 4 hours ($(6 + 2) / 2 = 4$)
which differs from the result we obtained in the above example.

What accounts for the difference?

This is because society as a whole produces a greater number of shirts
which require the shorter labor-time. If there had been twice as many shirts
produced in 6 hours than in the example, the socially necessary labor time
would have been greater.

Socially necessary labor therefore depends on the average technology used,
on the average skill of workers, and on the average conditions of labor.

None of these attributes is static. They continue to vary over time,
producing change in the socially necessary labor time, which tends to
decrease as these elements are perfected.

The introduction of a new machine only affects socially necessary labor time
if the innovation spreads rapidly through society.

If a sewer starts to use a sewing machine which allows them to sew a shirt in
one hour and everyone else keeps using the old machines, the innovation will
not have much influence on the socially necessary labor time. On the contrary, it
will allow this sewer to earn more since the value which regulates prices
will still be calculated using the average social time, which is greater than the
time needed by that sewer), and then in selling the shirt, they will get more
money in relation to their costs than other sewers. This is why in economies based
on exchange (including the capitalist economy), individual owners are forced to
introduce new machinery and to keep their technical advances secret.

Now then, to the extent that the use of a given machine is generalized,
it tends to lower the socially necessary time to produce a commodity, and
therefore its value as well as its price, which is nothing but an expression
of its value.

Finally, before explaining how this all goes in the capitalist system,
let's point out that it's necessary to distinguish between simple
labor and work which is more complex or specialized. One hour of
simple labor is not worth the same as an hour of complex labor.
The value produced by the labor of a specialized lathe operator
is much greater than that produced by simple labor like transporting
material from one place to another, packing boxes, etc.


## Surplus Value in the Capitalist Economy

### The impossibility of obtaining surplus value through exchange

Exchange in a capitalist society is much different from exchange as
we just analyzed it in a simple commodity economy.

If one goes into a shop in a capitalist city and tries to
negotiate down the price of a product, the first argument given
by the seller will not be the same as that given by the chair merchant:
that it cost them more than what you're offering. This time, the seller
will say that the sale of this object doesn't make them much profit;
that they cannot sell it at cost because they need to make something
off the sale.

In the simple commodity economy, what interests the small independent producer is
obtaining, through the sale of their products, the money
necessary to buy the products which they need to live. In the capitalist
economy, what interests the capitalist is selling their products so
that they get more money than the products cost them to produce.
Exchange does not make sense for the capitalist unless it brings
them more money than they used.

Before one tried to sell commodities (C) to obtain money (M) in order to
be able to buy other commodities (C); now one tries to have money which
allows one to buy commodities, which then allow one to obtain more money.

Therefore the simple-commodity formula of exchange would be:

$$C - M - C$$

And the capitalist formula of exchange would be

$$M - C - M$$

Now, the first question which arises is, where does the capitalist draw this greater
amount of money from?

Does it come from from a super-increase in prices, i.e., from the sale of commodities
above their value?

If the capitalists were a group that only sold and never had to buy, as long as there
existed another group with enough money to continuously buy without producing anything,
perhaps the issue could be explained in this way. But reality is different. The capitalist,
at the same time as they sell their products, has to buy other products to
be able to produce. They have to buy raw materials and instruments of labor from
other capitalists. Now, if these others raise their prices to, there would be a kind of
compensation at the societal level: what they would gain as buyers, they would lose as
sellers.

Therefore, the profit obtained by the capitalist cannot be explained through
exchange. That is, by saying that they sell their products for more than
they're worth.

How then can we explain how, selling goods at their value, capitalists can obtain a profit margin?

This problem can only be resolved if we find a commodity which can be bought by the capitalist,
and produce value through its use.

What is the commodity which at the same time as it's being used, produces more value?

If, as we saw earlier, the ultimate origin of value is human labor, than this
commodity can be none other than human labor power. It is the owner commodity
capable of creating value.

### Labor power as a commodity, and its value

Now, labor power[^sv.194] is not a commodity in every society. Neither in
slave-based societies, nor in the feudal mode of production, nor in
simple commodity production do workers freely sell their labor power.
In the first case, all of their being belongs to the slave-owner;
in the second, there was a specific kind of relationship of dependence
which forced the serf to do a certain amount of work for the lord;
in the final case we have independent producers who work for themselves.

What are the conditions necessary for labor power to emerge as a
commodity?

*First:* the existence of a free laborer who has the right to sell
their labor power.

*Second:* the existence of a free laborer who is lacking any 
means of production. In this way, in order to be able to live they need
to sell their labor power to whoever possesses the means of production:
the capitalist.

Now, what is it that determines the value of this commodity called *labor power*?

If the value of a commodity depends on the socially necessary labor time to
produce it, how should this statement be applied to labor power?

It seems hard to apply to labor power since it isn't produced in factories
but born in life through natural reproduction.

However, a careful examination of the capitalist system leads us to see
that the commodity of labor power is neither an exception nor a special
case of a commodity.

Let's see what the capitalist's use of labor power consists of.

The worker must work for the capitalist for a time determined by
their labor contract. Now, while working, acting on nature, the
worker expends a certain amount of muscular, nervous, and mental
force; that is, a certain amount of energy.

But, to maintain their labor power, the worker must reconstitute
the expended energy each day. And for this, they must consume a
certain amount of consumer goods: food, clothing, a house, etc.

Moreover, labor power must constantly flow into the market
and for that it's necessary to ensure workers' natural reproduction.
Therefore, the worker must have the means necessary to sustain their
family. If a worker has a spouse and five children, and the salary which
they receive only allows them to buy means of subsistence for themselves,
it's clear that they will share their means of subsistence among
the whole family and will be unable to reproduce all the energy
they've expended.
Thus, the cost of supporting a family must be included in
the value of labor power.

In addition to the foregoing, the worker has a certain number of
necessities corresponding to their cultural standard and the general level
of development of their country which also have to be taken into account.
This is one of the reasons that explain the differences in salary in
different countries. The European and North American worker earn much more
than the Latin American worker.

Finally, let's see what happens with specialized workers.

For one, owing to their higher cultural standard, 
they feel more things to be needs.
Moreover, the socially necessary labor time which was spent
during their education in the specialization must be kept
in mind, as with the things needed to maintain and increase
their level. Here we find the explanation for the higher
salaries given specialized workers.[^sv.izzy.specialized]

[^sv.izzy.specialized]: Translator's note: We find this explanation dubious.
[^sv.194]: See chapter 1.

The value of labor power is therefore equal to the value of all the products
necessary for its maintenance and reproduction in a given society.

With respect to this value the following points must be considered:

a. The basic needs of the worker and their family.
b. Cultural needs.
c. Level of specialization.

In general, the capitalist finds themself forced to pay for labor power at more
or less its value, as if they don't they have inferior results in production.
The capitalist knows that a well-fed worker produces much more than a hungry
worker.

### The formation of surplus value

Now, supposing that a capitalist buys labor power at its value -- which
does not always happen, especially in countries such as ours where the
number of unemployed workers grows day by day ensuring the capitalist
reliable replacement of the workforce which they need -- how do
they use that labor power to obtain their profit?

The capitalist and the worker meet in the labor market. The latter offers
their labor power as a commodity. The capitalist buys it for a certain
amount of money in order to make it to work over a certain period of time,
e.g., 8 hours.

Having bought it, the capitalist may use labor power as a use value. That is,
they may make it work, and indeed this is what they do.

Now, if the capitalist has bought the labor power for 20 dollars, and if these
20 dollars represent 4 hours of labor in money form, the worker will have
paid back the capitalist the money which they paid through 4 hours of labor.
But, since labor power has the property of producing more labor than is necessary
to reproduce it (and the capitalist knows this), the capitalist makes the labor
power work for 8 hours. The value created in the final 4 hours constitute a net
profit for the capitalist.

> We call **surplus value** the value which the worker creates in excess of
> the value of their labor power.

> We call **necessary or paid labor time** the labor time in which the worker
> reproduces the value of their labor power.

> We call **extra or unpaid labor time** the time in which surplus value
> is created for the capitalist.

The concept of surplus value is the key concept for explaining capitalist
exploitation. It is the source of capitalist profit.

### Capital as a factor of production

Labor power is not the only thing that participates in the capitalist production process.
Means of production (raw materials, machines, buildings, etc.) are also necessary.

If the capitalist doesn't monopolize into their own hands these means of production,
the worker wouldn't be forced to work for them.

The capitalist therefore gathers up in their hands the means of production,
just as with labor power.

> We the different elements of the labor process **capital** when they
> destined to produce surplus value for their owner.

It is important to insist on the fact that things come to be capital not
through their natural conditions, but through the specific relations of
production into which they are inserted. That is, through the
exploitation of the wage worker by the capitalist.

Labor power, in the case of simple commodity production, cannot be
considered capital. Nor can the wool with which a mother knits for her
child.

Therefore, capital is not a category that can be applied to every
society.

The means of production and labor power can only be considered capital
under capitalist production regime, when they are destined to produce
surplus value.

Let's now examine how the means of production participate in the
capitalist production process, and what the role they play
in this process is.

Let's start with what happens with machines.

A machine, a mechanical loom for example, can participate in various
production processes for fabrics. But it does not have an infinite
lifespan; it's used up as it's used. If we suppose that it lasts
some 10 years, we may say that each year it loses a tenth of
its value, which means that each year it transfers that amount
of value to the commodities produced.

If the machine is worth \$100,000 -- i.e., if it embodies that
amount of labor -- then each year it would transfer \$10,000
to the commodities produced. And if 5,000 products per year are produced
with that machine, then each produce will have \$2 ($\$10,000 / 5000$)
incorporated in it, which express the amount of labor that the machines
would transfer to them.

*Machines do not produce any new value*, but transfer their own value to
commodities bit by bit, that is, in a partial form.

Let's now see what happens with raw materials.

Raw materials (both principal and auxiliary ones[^sv.195]) completely
disappear; some forming a part of products and others, as with fuel,
in order to provide the energy and heat needed for the production
process. They therefore transfer their value completely to the product.

But despite the different forms in which they transfer their value to
the product, machines and raw materials have something in common.
*Neither of them can create value*, and can only transfer their
value insofar as they're put into action by human labor.

*Therefore, human labor does not just have the capacity to create
value, but also the capacity to make the means of production transfer
their value to products.*

Without human labor, the capitalist would get nothing out of having
enormous factories, full of modern machines.

We should distinguish in this way two forms of capital.

> We will call **constant capital** capital invested in means of production,
> because its value does not change in the production process.

> We will call *variable capital* capital invested in labor power,
> because it produces more value, and therefore, makes value vary (change).

The creation of surplus value is impossible without constant capital, as
labor power can only bear its fruits by putting the means of production into
action. But, despite constant capital being a condition for the creation of
surplus value, it cannot create it on its own. *Surplus value is only created
by labor.* Therefore, the amount of constant capital in existence does not
affect surplus value either. The same amount of surplus value can be produced
with very different constant capitals. For example, a factory with highly
advanced technology -- and therefore with a large amount of constant capital --
and employing 20 workers, and another with much cheaper technology and also
employing 20 workers, will produce the same amount of surplus value if
both manage to pay for the labor power with only 4 hours of the working day.
Thus the capitalists of the two factories produce the same amount of
surplus value in the unpaid hours of labor.

Therefore, to determine the level of exploitation of the working class, we are
not at all interested in examining how high the level of constant capital rises,
but only in what is the relationship between the value of labor power (or variable
capital) and the surplus value produced.

Let's give an example. If the value of some machinery is \$100,000, that of the
raw material \$10,000, that of the labor power \$20,000, and the surplus value
\$20,000, the rate of exploitation would be \$20,000 (surplus value) divided by
\$20,000 (variable capital). That is, 100%. This means that for each hour the
worker works, they are working half of that hour for free for the capitalist.

As long as the relationship between surplus value and variable capital does not
change, the rate of exploitation will not change -- despite great changes in the
amount of money that the capitalist invests in constant capital.

### Absolute and relative surplus value

We've already seen how the production of surplus value is what interests the
capitalist, since the more surplus value they obtain, the higher their profits
will be.

But how can they manage to produce more surplus value?

The first way the capitalist has of doing so is prolonging the working day
as much as possible, so that after the worker produces value equivalent to
the value of their labor power, they can continue working to produce surplus
value for the capitalist.

If a worker produces value equivalent to that of their labor power in 4 hours, and
works for an additional 4 hours, they'll produce a surplus value of 100%.
But if the capitalist manages to lengthen the working day to 12 hours, it's
clear that the worker will produce double the surplus value, and the rate of
exploitation will rise to 200%.

This way of obtaining more surplus value is very convenient for the capitalist,
as they don't have to increase their costs in terms of machines or space and
they get a much larger yield from the labor power employed.

This was the method used in the beginning of capitalism. But the working day
cannot be prolonged indefinitely. There are physical and historical limits.

*Physical*, since if the worker works for a long time, they will not be
able to rest enough to replenish their labor power in the proper way
and there will be an intense exhaustion with a corresponding drop in
performance.

*Historical*, since as capitalism develops, the working
class develops as well, and it becomes organized and starts to put up
an aggressive resistance toward capitalist exploitation. Through arduous
struggles it will continually manage to reduce the working day, forcing
the capitalist to look for other methods of increasing surplus value.

The capitalist can no longer increase surplus value by lengthening
the working day. On the contrary, due to pressure from the working class, they often 
must shorten it.

How then can the capitalist can obtain the surplus value without which his
existence would make no sense?

There are two ways of obtaining it: one, by intensifying labor, and two, by
reducing necessary labor time. That is, the time in which the worker works to
replenish their labor power.

Intensifying labor power means making it so that labor power yields the
maximum possible. Studies are done to see which movements are absolutely
necessary for performing a given kind of work, trying to eliminate all
superfluous movements. Music is put in, better lighting, etc., not because
of humanitarian sentiments but because it contributes to greater production.

Now, as the intensification of labor has a limit, since at some point
working at a greater intensity produced physical and mental exhaustion,
the capitalist must finally choose to try to reduce the necessary labor
time.

How can he do that?

Assuming that labor power is paid for at its value, the only way to
reduce the part of the working day dedicated to paying for its value is
by decreasing this value.

And how can its value be decreased?

By decreasing the value of the things that the worker consumes.

And how can the value of these things be decreased?

By producing them with less labor.

And how can the labor necessary to produce them be decreased?

By increasing the efficiency of labor through, fundamentally,
the perfecting of the means of labor. A modern loom produces
many more meters of fabric in an hour of labor than a
primitive one. In this way, each meter of fabric is cheapened
as they have fewer hours of labor incorporated in them.[^sv.196]

This is the reason why capitalists are so interested in lowering
the costs of the things which play a role in the maintenance
of labor power, and often, they seek out other measures in addition
to those indicated, such as subsidies for basic necessities so
that workers can buy them more cheaply. They do this not out
of philanthropy but in order to increase their profits.

If the value of consumer goods falls, the value of labor power falls
too and it therefore needs less time to repay its value.

If in the past 100% of surplus value was produced by making the worker
work 16 hours each day to produce the value corresponding to their
labor power -- in 8 hours -- and the other 8 for the capitalist, now,
the working day being reduced to 8 hours, it's possible to obtain
the same 100% of surplus value, managing to reduce the necessary
labor to 4 hours. And if they manage to reduce it to fewer hours,
the rate of surplus value would grow.

Now, from what has been said prior we can understand the reasons why
the capitalist system as such is interested in the continuous perfection
of machines. The increase in the productivity of labor which they make
possible allows them to obtain more surplus value without needing to
lengthen or intensify labor.

But, in addition to these reasons which are due to the system as such,
we can add the motivation of the individual capitalist, who by introducing
a new machine manages to produce at a lower cost than his competitors,
obtaining an extraordinary profit which arises from the difference between
the individual value of his products and the social value which these kind of
products have in the market.

Let's give an example: if a capitalist introduces a loom which allows him to
produce each hour twice the fabric as before, the value of that product would be
much reduced, but since the rest of the capitalists still work with older looms,
the social value -- or value properly said -- of the fabric is greater than the
individual value. And as it is this value which controls the price at which fabric is sold,
our capitalist will sell at the same price as the others while having a much lower
production cost and will therefore obtain an extraordinary profit.

Additionally, capitalists find themselves forced to continuously perfect their machinery,
since if they didn't, they wouldn't be able to compete with the other capitalists in
their branch of production. If one capitalist lags behind, if he does not manage to
increase the productivity of his labor at the same rate as the others, his costs of production
will be higher. And since he must sell at the price that is driven by value,
he will earn less, until the day comes when he earns nothing at all, finding himself forced
to close his factory.

All the reasons stated here allow us to see why the capitalist system needs to
continuously perfect the instruments of labor, machines.

This need is precisely the major stimulus for development of the productive
forces. No prior economic regime had so stimulated their development.

### The reserve army: the effect of capitalism on the working class

Machines, at the same time as they enormously increase the productivity of
labor (modern automatic looms produce way more fabric per hour than primitive
artisanal looms), also displace a huge part of the workforce. (The work which was
earlier done by 20 textile workers with individual primitive looms is now done with
just one machine which employs only two or three workers.) The workers thereby
displaced are left unemployed.

But are they left unemployed forever?

No, since it's necessary to create factories to produce these machines, to produce their
parts, to produce the energy with which they work, etc. At the same time as certain
sources of work close, others open in other sectors. Therefore, the workers who leave
one factory, after a certain amount of time, normally should find work in others.

Capitalist development therefore establishes, and at the same time requires to be able
to function, the perennial presence in the labor market of a certain amount of
workers available for the workforce needs which the capitalist class might have.
This is why Karl Marx called these unemployed workers, continuous changing from one
factory to another, the *reserve army of the capitalists*.[^sv.197]

[^sv.197]: In the dependent capitalist countries, this reserve army which Marx spoke of
in reference to the capitalism of developed countries, finds itself swollen with
a growing number of unemployed people, which is due to the introduction in these
countries of the technology of the more advance countries. That technology which,
instead of producing a gradual technological development which would allow, in the same
way, the reabsorption of the employed into other factories producing machines, leaves
a huge segment of the population without hope of finding work, displaced from the
petty factories of the artisanal sort by the great modern factories whose machines
come from abroad.

The existence of this army of workers is very convenient for the capitalists, and they
know how to use it well. They use it to pressure workers, so that they don't demand
too high salaries. Workers know that they can be replaced at any moment by their unemployed
colleagues who are often willing to accept starvation wages in order to have a job.
The capitalists use this struggle to get labor to break workers' unity, diverting
the struggle of the workers against the bosses into a struggle between themselves.

As a conclusion of everything said prior, we may state that
the workers will only liberate themselves from the chains that bind them
to the capitalists, and of all the ills that they cause, by destroying the capitalist ownership of
the means of production in order to transform it into the property of all the
workers through their state: the proletarian state.

## Summary

In this appendix we have tried to explain in a simple yet rigorous way the origin
of capitalist exploitation: the production of surplus value. We have had to start
by analyzing the simple commodity production process in order to later pass to
the capitalist production process. We have left behind appearances to discover
what is the explanation at the heart of the question. We have therefore left
prices to arrive at value. After having carefully examined the concept of value
and socially necessary labor, we have gone on to define surplus value based on
an analysis of the value of labor power. Later, so as to be able to distinguish
between absolute and relative surplus value, we have defined the concepts of
constant capital and variable capital. Finally, we have spent some time with one of
the effects of capitalism on the working class: the reserve army.

In this appendix we have seen the following concepts:

- value
- socially necessary labor time
- surplus value
- absolute surplus value
- relative surplus value
- capital
- value of labor power
- constant capital
- variable capital
- reserve army.
