# The Marxist Theory of History

## Introduction

Since the first historians that emerged in the Greek world, the great majority
have limited themselves to making chronologies of past events. The most significant
events were used as periodization criteria (for example, the battles, the conquests,
the birth of Jesus, etc.). The great contribution of the few philosophers of history,
like Hegel, was to have sought a principle with which to render the stages of history intelligible.

Let's see what Engels has to say:

> the philosophy of history, particularly as represented by Hegel, recognizes that the ostensible and also the really operating motives of men who act in history are by no means the ultimate causes of historical events; that behind these motives are other motive powers, which have to be discovered. But it does not seek these powers in history itself, it imports them rather from outside, from philosophical ideology, into history. Hegel, for example, instead of explaining the history of ancient Greece out of its own inner interconnections, simply maintains that it is nothing more than the working out of “forms of beautiful individuality”, the realization of a “work of art” as such. He says much in this connection about the old Greeks that is fine and profound, but that does not prevent us today from refusing to be put off with such an explanation, which is a mere manner of speech[^11.1]

Let's briefly explain the Hegelian conception of history so that we can determine what is
novel in Marx with respect to Hegel.

## The Hegelian theory of history

Because the categories of history and time are intimately related to each other,
let us study the essential characteristics of Hegelian historical time in order to
understand the foundation of his theory of history.

The characteristics of Hegelian historical time are

a. Homogeneous continuity
b. Contemporaneity 

**Homogeneous continuity:** For Hegel, time has the character of homogeneous continuity.
It is like water in a river that runs continuously, passing through different landscapes.
Each of these landscapes would be a stage of history. This continuity of time is based on
the dialectical continuity of the development process of the Absolute Spirit. The ultimate
cause of the apparent motives of people's actions in history should be sought in the 
development of the Absolute Spirit, the Idea. There is a type of soul in history that
appears differently in the distinct historical stages (the abstract personality in Rome,
beauty in Greece, subjectivity in medieval christianity, etc.).

If history is constituted by homogeneous time, the entire problem of the historian
consists of cutting up this continuum according to the periodization corresponding
to the succession of stages of the development of the Idea.

**Contemporaneity or the category of the historical present.** The necessary condition
for making historical divisions, following the different stages of the evolution of
the Idea, is to be able to capture, in each division, the global social totality. The
social totality must be set up in such a way that all of its elements coexist at
the same time. This characteristic is typical of a totality which has a spiritual unity.
That is, a totality in which each part expresses the central nucleus of the whole.

The reduction of all those elements that form the concrete life of a historical
world (economic, social, political, and legal institutions, customs, morality, art,
religion, philosophy, and even the historical events: wars, battles, defeats, etc.)
to a principle of internal unity, this same reduction is not possible except
under the absolute condition of considering the entire concrete life of a people
as the exteriorization/alienation of an internal spiritual principle. That is, not of
its material reality but of its most abstract ideology[^11.2]

The idea of historical time elaborated by Hegel is nothing but a reflection of the
lived experience of time. We believe in one-and-only-one time where we see a past, a present, and
a future. We believe we distinguish different periods in our own personal history,
periods that we determine according to the most important events of our lives.

Hegel's notion of historical time is an ideological notion, taken from lived experience,
and it is directly related to Hegel's conception of the social totality.
The existence of homogeneous time and the possibility of making historical divisions that
permit us to see the essence of the social totality are directly tied to the Hegelian
conception of the totality as a whole, which possesses a spiritual unity.

## The Marxist theory of history

What is the novelty of Marx with respect to the theory of history? Does it consist in
having described a new criterion of periodization (the criterion of "modes of production")?

To hold that the novelty of Marx resides in the description of a new periodization of history --
that of "modes of production" -- is to remain within the Hegelian conception of history. Inside
one-and-only-one homogeneous historical time, which now, instead of being divided according to the
development of the idea, is divided according to a material criterion: the mode of production of
material goods and the juridico-political and ideological consequences thereof.

Unfortunately, the few texts of Marx and Engels about their conception of history lend themselves to
this kind of interpretation.

Engels tells us, for example, that "The traditional conception, to which Hegel, too, pays homage, saw in the state the determining element, and in civil society the element determined by it." And he adds that appearances
undoubtedly justify this idea. For Marxism, on the other hand, "the state -- the political order -- is the subordination, and civil society — the realm of economic relations — the decisive element."[^11.3]

In this text, Engels identifies civil society with economic structure, and the state with the juridico-political
and ideological superstructure. The inversion is clear: while in Hegel it is the political-ideological
(the self-consciousness of an era) which is the essence of the economic, in Marx it would be the economic
which is the essence of the political-ideological. The juridico-political and ideological superstructure would
be, therefore, a mere economic phenomenon.[^11.4]

The theory of history would pass from the spiritualist evolutionism of Hegel to the materialist evolution
of Marxism. And the criteria for periodization of history would come not out of the dialectical evolution of the Idea,
but out of the dialectical evolution of the economy.

The novelty of Marx would remain reduced to the inversion of Hegel's conception. Following the formulation of
Marx himself, he would say of Hegel, "With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again."

Now then, as we have seen throughout this work, it is not enough to stay at the level of the letter of
these texts. It is necessary to study them in a critical way and to try to discover, through a global study
of the works of these authors, what their true approach to history was.

Marx and Engels did not systematically and rigorously elaborate an explicit approach for their theory
of history[^11.5], but their study of the capitalist mode of production has given us the theoretical instruments
which allow us to elaborate this theory.

To elaborate the Marxist concept of history, it is necessary to begin with the Marxist concept of
social totality.

In chapter 8, we saw that the abstract concept that lets us understand the social totality is the concept of
*mode of production*: the dynamic global structure, composed of three regional structures: economic, ideological,
and juridico-political. Now then, each of these structures has a relatively autonomous existence and its own laws of
operation and development, while still being determined in the last instance by the economic structure.
The levels of the superstructure are not, therefore a simple expression of the economic level.
They have their own relatively independent reality. To say that a level of society has
its own existence and its own laws of development is to affirm that it has its own relatively
autonomous "time"; relatively independent, in its very dependence, from the "times" of the
other levels.

If we study, for example, the transition from feudalism to capitalism, we see that the
time of the economic structure was not the same as that of the juridico-political structure.
The capitalist social relations of production established themselves spontaneously within
the feudal social formation -- the first capitalist manufacturers coexisted with feudal
agricultural exploitation -- but the state and rights continued to be in the service of
the old ruling class. The bourgeois revolution synchronized these two times to each other.

In the case of the transition from capitalism to socialism, the
capitalist economic structure and its laws of development block all possibility
of the emergence of socialist relations of production. This necessitates the taking
of political power by the proletariat to begin establishing said relations.
This "anticipation" of the economic relations by the political relations, in the transition
to socialism, is determined by the precise articulation of these relations.

Therefore, each structure in a given mode of production has its own time, time which is
not immediately visible but must be constructed in each case.

To explain the last point we'll take an example from psychology: a biography does
not tell the life of a person following time as a clock marks it (hours, days, months, years, etc.),
but strives to point out the important occurrences which have marked their life:
meetings, discoveries, accidents, etc. The time of biography is a time which is
visible in the events which have taken place in that personal life. But Freud has
showed us that to remain in this visible time, in the time of biography, it to
remain on the surface of a human life. It is to remain on the level of description.
To know a person is necessarily to know the fundamental structure of their
personality. Freud's great contribution is having produced the concept which lets us know
this fundamental structure: *the concept of the unconscious and its different
phases of development* (oral, anal, phallic, oedipal, the period of latency, etc.).

The profound meaning of the facts of a biography is only intelligible by starting
from their position within a certain phase of psychic development.

The death of their father, for example, has a very different meaning for a child
that is in the oedipal phase (conquest of the love of the mother), than for a child
that has not yet reached that stage, or which has already passed it.
The first may suffer strong feelings of guilt, thinking it was they who killed their
father, as they unconsciously desired in their imagination.

The time of biography is a time which is visible, vivid, linear.
The time of the unconscious is a time which is not visible, which must be constructed
for each stage of development of psychic life, each of these stages being what
allows us to pass from the simple enumeration of facts to their understanding.

We can, therefore, conclude that neither the Freudian theory of the development of
the psyche nor the Marxist theory of history of the society are absolutely situated
at the level of visible empirical history, which develops in a time that is unitary,
linear, simply "chronological."

Let us now take another example properly belong to the field of
history: the time of the history of philosophy.

```ghost
```

The time of the history of philosophy is also not immediately legible:
certainly one sees, in the historical chronology, philosophers follow
one another, and one can this sequence as the history itself.
But here again it is necessarily to renounce the ideological prejudices
of the succession of the visible and start *constructing the concept of
the time of the history of philosophy*.[^11.6]

It is necessary therefore to construct to the concept of the time of philosophy
starting from the succession of different philosophical problematics. That is,
from the typical systematic structures that unify the different elements of
a thought.

Within a single problematic we can find multiple philosophers.

We can note radical changes of problematic (Marx in relation to Hegel), but
we can also note secondary changes (Feuerbach with respect to Hegel).

The history of philosophy, to acquire the character of scientific history,
should therefore, abandon the chronological study of the different philosophers
and move on to the study of the different philosophical problematics which have
existed, locating the philosophers within their respective problematics.

Marx does not limit himself, therefore, to offering a new criterion of
periodization. The very nature of this criterion implies a complete
transformation in the way of posing of the problem. It is no longer
about a linear, homogeneous, historical temporality of the Hegelian type,
but about certain specific structures of historicity.

In the same way that "production in general" does not exist, "history in general"
does not exist, but specific structures of historicity.[^11.7]

These *specific structures of historicity are the different modes of production*,
based, in the last instance, on a certain mode of production of material goods.

**The Marxist theory of history is, therefore, a scientific study of the
discontinuous succession of the different modes of production.**

The Marxist theory of history, that has as its object the study of the
different modes of production, must be put in the service of the study of
concrete realities. It must serve to produce historical understandings that
are situated at another level, at the level of social formations and their
political conjunctures.

At this level, what differentiates a Marxist historian from a non-Marxist one
is the use of the Marxist theory of history -- that is, the body of concepts
of historical materialism -- in the study of a historically given, concrete object.

One should not confuse, therefore, *the theory of history* with the *scientific, empirical
knowledge* about a given historical reality.

## Historical materialism, general theory and regional theories

In the chapter about the concepts of *mode of production and social formation* we saw
that *Capital*, the most finished work of Marx, has as its object the study of
the capitalist mode of production. That is, an abstract object which is
never found in a pure state in reality. We have also seen the limits of this study:
it gives us scientific knowledge of the economic level of the capitalist mode of
production in its pre-monopoly phase. Marx was not able to complete his initial project:
the study of all of the levels of the capitalist mode of production.

But what is it that guides Marx in the scientific study of the capitalist mode of
production? What is his "guiding thread"?

His "guiding thread" is the *theory of historical materialism* articulated by him 
in a systematic form in the preface to the *Critique of political economy*. In the
previous chapters we have studied the *main concepts* of this scientific theory of history.

Now then, the *general concepts* of historical materialism employed in *Capital* are
different than the *specific concepts* developed in that work which constitute the theory of the economic
level of the capitalist mode of production. These *specific concepts* -- abstract labor and
concrete labor, the relation between exchange-value and use-value, constant capital and
variable capital, etc. -- are concepts that only serve to study the economic level of
the capitalist mode of production. The scientific study of the economic level of
the feudal mode of production or of the socialist mode of production requires other
specific concepts.

Marx clearly distinguishes these two categories of concepts when referring to his
plan of study about capitalist society in the *Introduction to the critique of
political economy*:

> The disposition of material has evidently to be made in such a way that (section) one comprises general abstract definitions, which therefore appertain in some measure to all social formations, but in the sense set forth earlier. Two, the categories which constitute the internal structure of bourgeois society[^11.8]

Which are these general definitions for Marx?

We think that they can be by 1), carefully reading the "general result" which Marx arrived at and which, once acquired, serves as the guiding thread
in "his studies", exposed by him in the preface to the *Critique of Political Economy* and 2), studying
the fourth point of the *Introduction to the Critique of Political Economy*.

Marx begins this fourth point with a series of general concepts: "Production, means of production,
relations of production and relations of circulation, forms of the state and of consciousness
in relation to the conditions of productions and circulation, legal relations, family relations".

We can, therefore, conclude that in order to study the capitalist mode of production scientifically,
one needs a body of concepts that are more general, more abstract, than those concepts specific
to that mode of production.

We must, therefore, distinguish in historical materialism a *general theory* -- or body of concepts
used in the study of distinguishing each mode of production -- and *regional theories*
of the different modes of production (slavery-based, feudal, capitalist, socialist, etc.) and
of the transition from one mode of production to another.

If we want, for example, to place in a precise way the Marxist theory of the dictatorship
of the proletariat, we must indicate that it does not pertain to the general theory of
historical materialism but to a regional theory: the theory of the transition from
the capitalist mode of production to the socialist mode of production, and more
precisely, to the subregion of the juridico-political part of that era of transition.

## Levels of "realization" of the theory of historical materialism: the science of the social formations and the science of the political conjuncture

Historical materialism is a scientific theory. As a scientific theory, it does not give us knowledge
of concrete realities. *Capital*, for example, does not give us knowledge of a 
historically given concrete society, but knowledge of an abstract object: the pure capitalist mode of 
production.

Historical materialism, like all *theory*, does not give us any concrete knowledge, but
gives us the means (instruments of intellectual labor) which permit us to
obtain scientific knowledge of concrete objects. Therefore, as we saw in the
introduction, if historical materialism is not used in the analysis of concrete
realities, it can be considered an amputated theory which has not fulfilled its
objective, like an arrow that is spun between ones fingers without ever being shot.

We will call, following Althusser, *theoretical concepts* those concepts which, by
forming part of a scientific theory, do not give us knowledge of any concrete
reality. Namely, the concepts of the general theory and the regional theories of
historical materialism. We will call *empirical concepts* those concepts which give
us knowledge of concrete reality[^11.9].

These *empirical concepts* are not a pure and simple copy of reality, a pure and
simple immediate reading of it. However, they cannot exist without using
data from observation and experience.

An inquiry or an observation is never a passive effect; it is only possible if
it is driven and controlled by theoretical concepts that act on it, either directly
or indirectly, through its rules of observation, choice, and classification,
in the technical setup that constitutes the field of observation or of experience.
Therefore, an inquiry or an observation, or, even more, an experience, provides
but the material which is later processed into the fundamental elements through a subsequent effort
of transformation which will produce, finally, the empirical concepts.
By the "empirical concepts", then, we do not mean the starting material, but
the result of that material after undergoing successive stages of processing.
We therefore have in view the result of a process of complex knowledge,
in which the initial material, and later the fundamental elements obtained therefrom,
are transformed into empirical concepts thanks to the involvement of the
theoretical concepts, sea en persona, sea presentes, y en acción, en esta elaboración bajo la forma de
montajes experimentales, reglas de método, reglas de crítica y de interpretación.

Therefore, the relation of the theoretical concepts to the empirical concepts is not, in any case,
a relation of outward appearance (the theoretical concepts are not reduced to the
empirical data), nor a relation of deduction (the empirical concepts are not deduced from
the theoretical concepts), nor a relation of subsumption (the empirical concepts
are not the complementary particular part of the generality of the theoretical concepts,
simply as particular cases.) One should better say (in a sense close to an expression of
Marx when he speaks of the "realization of surplus value") that empirical concepts "realize"
theoretical concepts in the concrete knowledge of concrete objects.
The dialectic of such a "realization" will require comprehensive clarification which can
only be produced on the base of a theory of the practice of science and its history[^11.10].

There are two levels of "realization" in the Marxist theory of history (i.e., historical materialism).
The first is the level of the social formation, that is, the level of a historically given social
structure that takes the form of a concrete individuality, which maintains a certain identity
through its transformations. This is in the same way that Peter has a personality structure
which keeps a certain identity throughout his life, despite going through different stages of
development.

The second is the level of the political conjuncture, or the "present moment" of said social structure.
That is, the particular forms which that individuality takes in the various historical moments.

Summarizing what we just said, we can distinguish two levels of "realization" of historical materialism:

1. The science of social formations
2. The science of the conjuncture.

Now then, before moving onto the next point, we want to stress here something
which we comprehensively developed in the introduction. The Marxist theory was created
to change the world, and therefore, its true, final realization is in its use in a
truly revolutionary political practice.

## Historical materialism: science which opposes dogmatism and revisionism[^11.11]

Historical materialism is a science. Because it is a science, it is
against dogmatism and revisionism.

To know that something is a science is, at the same time, to know that it cannot
live without the condition of *developing itself*. A science that repeats itself
without discovering anything is a dead science; it is no longer a science, but
a fixed dogma. A science only lives through its development, that is, through its
discoveries. This point is equally important, since we may be tempted to believe
that we have in historical materialism and dialectical materialism, as they are
given to us today, finished sciences, and that we should distrust, on principle,
any new discovery. Certainly, the workers' movement has reasons for staying alert
against the revisionists who have always dressed themselves in titles of "innovation"
or "updating"; but this necessary defense has nothing to do with suspicion toward
the discoveries of a living science.

Marx, Engels, and Lenin expressed themselves unambiguously on this point.
When Marx, in a celebrated display of humor, said that he was "not a Marxist",
he wanted to say that he considered what he had done as a mere beginning of a science,
since a finished knowledge would be an absurdity that would lead sooner or later to
a non-science.

Engels said the same when wrote, for example, in 1877:

> These two great discoveries, the materialistic conception of history and the revelation of the secret of capitalistic production through surplus-value, we owe to Marx. With these discoveries socialism became a science. The next thing was to work out all its details and relations.[^11.12]

Lenin proclaims the same fact more strongly, in 1899:

> There can be no strong socialist party without a revolutionary theory which unites all socialists, from which they draw all their convictions, and which they apply in their methods of struggle and means of action. To defend such a theory, which to the best of your knowledge you consider to be true, against unfounded attacks and at tempts to corrupt it is not to imply that you are an enemy of all criticism. We do not regard Marx’s theory as some thing completed and inviolable; on the contrary, we arc convinced that it has only laid the foundation stone of the science which socialists must develop in all directions if   they wish to keep pace with life. We think that an independent elaboration of Marx’s theory is especially essential for Russian socialists; for this theory provides only general guiding principles, which, in particular, are applied in England differently than in France, in France differently than in Germany, and in Germany differently than in Russia.[^11.13]

Althusser points out the main points of this text:

1. Marx has given us, in the theoretical field, the "cornerstones", the "guiding principles". That is, the theoretical
  principles of the basis of a theory which is *absolutely necessary to develop*.
2. This theoretical development is for all socialists a *duty* to their science; if they do not carry it out, they fail in their duty to socialism.
3. It is necessary not only to develop the general theory, but also to develop its *particular applications*, the nature of each concrete case.
4. This defense and this develop of the Marxist science supposes, at the same time, two things.
  First, the greatest firmness against all those who want to drag us back, further away from the scientific principles of Marx.
  Second, a true freedom of criticism and scientific investigation carried out on the basis of
  the theoretical principles of Marx by those who are able and willing to go further, a freedom indispensable
  for the life of Marxist science and for any other science[^11.14].

Finally, to finish, we want to quote from the following text of Mao Zedong:

> Dogmatic formulas, empty and dry, destroy our creative possibilities. Not only that, they destroy Marxism. A dogmatic "Marxism" is not Marxism, it is anti-Marxism.[^11.15]

## The Marxist theory and the role of human beings in history

Is there an internal contradiction in the importance that Marxism places on
the class struggle -- that is, on people's action on history -- and its
affirmation of historical determinism.

Already in 1843 Marx wrote the following in a letter to Ruge:

> We shall not say: Abandon your struggles, they are mere folly; let us provide you with true campaign-slogans. Instead, we shall simply show the world why it is struggling, and consciousness of this is a thing it must acquire whether it wishes or not.[^11.16]

Commenting on these words of Marx, Lenin said:
> This slogan was found by Marx, “not a utopian, but a strict and, in places, even dry scientist”...[and it was found] by a scientific analysis of the present bourgeois regime, by an elucidation of the necessity of exploitation under this regime, by an investigation of the laws of its development.[^11.17]

In this text we see how the *necessity* of the laws which govern the capitalist society do not imply that
people will be passive before these laws.

Let us once again give Lenin the floor:

> ...this is one of the favorite themes of the subjective philosopher: the idea of
> conflict between determinism and morality, between historical necessity and the
> significance of the individual. On this theme he has left ink-stained a mountain
> of papers, filling an abyss with his absurd, sentimental, Philistine chatter,
> in order to resolve this conflict in favor of morality and the role of the individual.
> In reality such a conflict does not exist...the idea of historical necessity
> [does not] lessen the role of the individual in history;
> all history is comprised precisely of individuals' actions ...
> The real question which arises when evaluating the activity of an individual in society consists in
> knowing what conditions would ensure the success of this activity.
> What guarantees that this activity will not result in an individual act which will
> drown in a sea of opposing ones?[^11.18]

Therefore, in the face of the rejection of Marxism by spritualist philosopher, which
accuses it of being an exponent of absolute material determinism -- that which annuls
all possibility of the creative participation of human beings in history -- Marxism
responds: in reality it is human beings who make history, but they make it under
certain given conditions. And for that reason the Marxist researcher will analyze
first of all those conditions of existence. Especially the material conditions:
the form in which people produce material goods and the social relations under
which they carry out this productive activity.

In general, Marxism does not speak of history as the work of "living individuals",
insofar as it sees this phrase as empty. In analyzing the real social
relations and their *real* development, it analyzes precisely the product of
individuals' activity. Conversely, spiritualist philosophy speaks without a doubt
of individuals, of man, but in reality does not take them as its starting point
in its study. This is because it does not study the conditions which constitute
them (their effective conditions of existence, the system of relations of production)
but thinks of them "as puppets whose heads they fill with their own thoughts and
feelings"[^11.todo.181mh]

The actions of human beings, which appear infinitely varied and difficult to systematize,
were generalized by Marxism and related to the actions of groups of individuals which
differ from each other by the location they occupy within social production. That is,
they were connected to the actions of certain social classes. It is *class struggle and
not the action of isolated individuals* which determines the course of progression of
history.

In this way, we refute the purely mechanical and childish conception of the
subjectivists who vainly content themselves with saying that history is the
work of living individuals, without bothering to investigate what social environment
determines the actions of individuals and how it functions.

Let's see now how Lenin studies the action of a particular individual in Russian History, Father Gapon,
starting with the famous "Bloody Sunday" of January 9th, 1905:

> Here, in Russia, too, a priest found himself at the head of the movement; one day he appealed for a march with a peaceful petition to the tsar himself, and the next day he issued a call for revolution.... "We no longer have a tsar. Today a river of blood divides him from the Russian people. It is time for the Russian workers to begin the struggle for the people’s freedom without him...."
>
>  This is not Father Georgi Gapon speaking. This is the voice of those thousands upon thousands, of those millions upon millions of Russian workers and peasants who until now could believe naively and blindly in the Tsar Father and seek alleviation of their unbearable lot from Our Father the Tsar “himself”, who put the blame for all the atrocities and outrages, the tyranny and plunder, only on the officials that were deceiving the tsar. Generation after generation of downtrodden, half-civilised, rustic existence cut off from the world tended to strengthen this faith. Every month of life of the new, urban, industrial, literate Russia has been undermining and destroying this faith. The past decade of the working-class movement has produced thousands of advanced proletarian Social-Democrats who have consciously broken with this faith. It has educated scores of thousands of workers in whom the class instinct, strengthened in the strike movement and fostered by political agitation, has shattered this faith to its foundations. Behind these scores of thousands, however, stood hundreds of thousands, millions, of toiling and exploited people, proletarians and semi-proletarians, suffering every insult and indignity, in whom this faith could still survive. They were not ready for revolt, they could only beg and plead. Their feelings and their mood, their level of knowledge and political experience were expressed by Father Georgi Gapon; herein lies the historic significance of the role played at the beginning of the Russian revolution by a man who, but yesterday unknown, has today become the hero of the hour in St. Petersburg and, as a result, in the entire European press.[^9.

The history of this person shows us how the action of an individual became a
historic action due to the fact that it was the expression of a social force,
which is in turn is situated within the objective limits of the structure.

Now we can better understand the claim of the Marxist theorist who in
speaking of history, distinguishes between the terms "person" or "individual" and
the terms "mass" and "class."

Marxism holds that in class societies, *it is not the individual or individuals in
general who make history*, but the *masses*. That is, the *social forces involved
in the class struggle* are the *motor of history*.

By not understanding the true sense of the Marxist theory of history and the
role that class struggle plays in it, one often falls into two errors that
are disastrous for the revolutionary movement. The first is *economism* or
*spontaneism*, which advocates surrender to the laws of economic development,
and the second is *voluntarism*, which ignores the minimal objective conditions
necessary to undertake victorious revolutionary action.
