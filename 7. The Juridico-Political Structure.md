# The Juridico-Political Structure[^7.1]

Every society, in addition to having given economic and
ideological structures, possesses a combination of
institutional apparatuses and norms designed to regulate the
operation of society as a whole. These institutional
apparatuses and norms constitute the juridico-political
structure of the society, and form a part of the
superstructure.

The forms of these institutional apparatuses, their
importance and their normative principles, vary with the
economic structure on which they are based.

In class societies, the juridico-political level is secured by
an autonomous apparatus: the State, which monopolizes
"legitimate violence" and whose major function is to
maintain, under the domination of the ruling class, all the
other classes which depend on it.

This explains one of the fundamental theses of Marxism:
*the State is an instrument of the ruling classes' coercion of the
oppressed classes*.

## The Double Function of the State
In the previous point we saw that every society needs
certain institutional apparatuses and norms which allow it
to regulate its internal operations. This necessity is
ultimately based on the social division of labor. To the
degree that this division increases, the need to have a body of
individuals capable of organizing and administering the
society as a whole also increases.

To this technical function (organizational and
administrative), characteristic of every society in which
there is a minimal division of labor, a new function is added
in class societies: that of political domination. The existing
institutional apparatuses and norms are used to subject the
different classes of the society to the interests of the ruling
classes, and new apparatuses and institutions with
fundamentally repressive purposes are created: armed
detachments, jails, coercive institutions of every kind, etc.

This function appears, therefore, only when the division
of society into opposing classes arises. That is, when the
productivity of social labor produces a surplus which is
monopolized by a group of individuals of that society.

> This expresses with perfect clarity the basic idea of Marxism with regard to the historical role and the meaning of the state. The state is a product and a manifestation of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms. The state arises where, when and insofar as class antagonism objectively cannot be reconciled. And, conversely, the existence of the state proves that the class antagonisms are irreconcilable.[^7.2]

Now then, this eminently political function is supported by
the function that we have called technical-administrative, as
is demonstrated in the following text of Engels:

> But with the difference in distribution, *class differences*[^7.3]
  emerge. Society divides into classes: the privileged and
  the dispossessed, the exploiters and the exploited, the
  rulers and the ruled; and the state[^7.4] -- which the primitive
  groups of communities of the same tribe had at first
  arrived at only for safeguarding their common interests
  (such as irrigation in the East) and providing protection
  against external enemies -- from this stage onward
  acquires just as much the function of maintaining by
  force the economic and political position of the ruling
  class against the subject class.[^7.5]

Thus only when, along with the technical-administrative
function, the function of political domination arises can we
speak of the appearance of the State as such.

To clarify this double character of the state, let us examine
what Marx says about the double character of the function
of supervision and management of production in class
societies:

> The labor of supervision and management is naturally
> required wherever the direct process of production
> assumes the form of a combined social process, and not
> of the isolated labor of independent producers. However,
> it has a double nature.
>
> On the one hand, all labor in which many individuals
> co-operate necessarily requires a commanding will to
> co-ordinate and unify the process, and functions which
> apply not to partial operations but to the total activity of
> the workshop, much as that of an orchestra conductor.
> This is a productive job, which must be performed in
> every combined mode of production.
>
> On the other hand...this supervision work necessarily
> arises in all modes of production based on the
> antagonism between the laborer, as the direct producer,
> and the owner of the means of production. The greater
> this antagonism is, the greater the role played by the
> supervisor. Hence, this reaches its peak in the slave
> system. But it is indispensable also in the capitalist mode
> of production, since, the production process in it is
> simultaneously a process by which the capitalist
> consumes labor power. Just as in the despotic states,
> supervision and all around interference by the
> government involves both the performance of common
> activities arising from the nature of all communities, and
> the specific functions arising from the antagonism
> between the government and the mass of people.[^7.6]

We could say that, in the same way in which the technical
division of labor within an enterprise gives rise to the
function of supervision and management whose object is the
coordination of all the work that goes on in it, the social
division of labor requires a combination of institutional
apparatuses and norms designed to regulate the functioning
of society as a whole. This function of organization and
management, of a technical-administrative nature, is
overdetermined in both cases by the effects of the division of
society into classes. On the level of the enterprise, the
function of organization and management acquires a
character of exploitation of the workers by the owners of the
means of production, and at the level of the state it is utilized
to reproduce the political and economic conditions for the
exploitation of one class by another.

To sum up: the State has a double function: a technical
administrative function and a function of political
domination. *The latter is what properly defines the state*,
overdetermining the technical administrative function, that
is, orienting it, putting it at the service of the function of
political domination. There are not, therefore, technical-administrative
state tasks that are neutral in character.

Why, then, insist on this function?

In fact, Marx Engels, and Lenin have fundamentally
emphasized the function of political domination, rarely
referring to the technical-administrative function. We think
that this can be understood by the requirements of
ideological struggle against the bourgeois thesis of the
existence of a State above classes, that is, a state reduced
entirely to its technical function.

We consider it important not to ignore this function for
two reasons: 

a. In order to combat bourgeois ideology about the state, we must begin with
  what it lays out and show how the technical-administrative functions
  obscure the functions of political domination
b. To confirm only the existence of the function of political
  domination has led to "voluntarist" errors, that is, to
  conceive of the state as a product linked exclusively to the
  will of the ruling classes to dominate. In fact, they do not
  create the state so that it serves their class interests, but they
  utilize an already existing juridico-political apparatus,
  modifying it to reach their class objectives. The social
  function (i.e., the technical-administrative function) which this
  apparatus performs, serves as a basis for the new function of
  political domination.

It is in this way that we interpret the following text of
Engels:

> ...the exercise of a social function was everywhere the
  basis of political supremacy: and further that political
  supremacy has existed for any length of time only when it
  fulfilled its social functions.[^7.7]

## The Withering Away of the State

In addition, distinguishing these two functions helps us to understand
the Marxist thesis about the *withering away* of the state,
which is opposed to the anarchist thesis of the *suppression* of
the state.

Marxists hold that, when the proletariat takes refuge in political
power, the state will not be able to disappear the following
day. It is necessary to destroy the old apparatus and
construct a new one with a proletarian character, because
the class struggle will continue and, therefore, an apparatus
which fulfills the function of the repression of the classes
which are opposed to the building of socialism will be
needed. Anarchists maintain that, on the contrary, it is
necessary to immediately dissolve the whole "bureaucratic"
apparatus permitting the free organization of the
population at the level of its mass fronts.

The Marxist thesis maintains, however, that this
proletarian type of state will tend to disappear, will tend to
wither away.

To the degree that it advances towards communism,
towards the greater and greater suppression of class
differences, the function of political domination, which
defines the state as such, tends to disappear, letting survive
only the technical-administrative functions. In this way the
workers' state will continue disappearing gradually. The
government of individuals transforms into the
"administration of things and the direction of the processes
of production."

> When ultimately it becomes really representative of
> society as a whole, it makes itself superfluous. As soon as
> there is no longer any class of society to be held in
> subjection; as soon as along with class domination and
> the struggle for individual existence based on the former
> anarchy of production, the collisions and excesses arising
> from these have also been abolished, there is nothing
> more to be repressed which would make a special
> repressive force, a state, necessary. The first act in which
> the state really comes forward as the representative of
> society as a whole -- taking possession of the means of
> production in the name of society -- is at the same time its
> last independent act as a state. The interference of the
> state power in social relations becomes superfluous in
> one sphere after another, and then ceases of itself. The
> government of individuals is replaced by the
> administration of things and the direction of the
> processes of production. The state is not "abolished," it
> withers away.[^7.8]

Now let us look at the way Lenin compliments this text:

> ...only communism makes the state absolutely
unnecessary, for there is nobody to be suppressed --
"nobody" in the sense of a class, of a systematic struggle
against a definite section of the population. We are not
utopians and do not in the least deny the possibility and
inevitability of excesses on the part of individual persons,
or the need to stop such excesses. In the first place,
however, no special machine, no special apparatus of
suppression is needed for this; this will be done by the
armed people themselves, as simply and as readily as any
crowd of civilized people, even in modern society,
interferes to put a stop to a scuffle or to prevent a woman
from being assaulted. And, secondly, we know that the
fundamental social cause of excesses, which consist in the
violation of the rules of social intercourse is the
exploitation of the people, their want and their poverty.
With the removal of this chief cause, excesses will
inevitably begin to "wither away." We do not know how
and in what succession, but we do know they will wither
away. With their withering away the state will also wither
away.[^8.9]

## The State Apparatus and Political Power

One of the distinctive feature of every State is the existence
of a particular group of individuals who work for the State
apparatus. No one could call the state a community in which
all the members of society assure, each in his turn, "the
organization of order."[^8.10]

The *state apparatus* is the organism which carries out the
technical-administrative tasks and the job of political
domination belonging to the dual function of the state.
Thus, although the technical-administrative function is as
we saw in the previous pages, *overdetermined by the
political function*, we think that it is important to distinguish
it from this latter function since this permits us to distinguish
within the State apparatus an apparatus fundamentally
technical-administrative (corp of civil servants) and an
apparatus that is fundamentally repressive (a standing
army, police bureaucracy).

*Political power* is the capacity to utilize the apparatus of
the State to carry out the political objectives of the ruling
class.

It is important, therefore, not to confuse the apparatus of
the state or the state machinery with political power. The
*fundamental object of the class struggle concerns the
political power of the State*. The class or classes that have
obtained this power put the apparatus of the state at their
service. It has been like this in all the non-proletarian
revolutions. Nonetheless, the practical political experiences
of the proletariat in the Paris Commune, convinced Marx
that "the working class cannot simply take possession of the
existing state machinery and put it to work for its own ends."
The working class must "smash," "destroy" the military
bureaucratic apparatus of the bourgeois state and replace it
with an apparatus totally different with a proletarian
apparatus which permits it to continue to, little by little,
make the State, as such disappear, as an organ of repression
and political domination.

Therefore we should not confuse the "destruction of the
bourgeois state apparatus" with the "withering away of the
proletarian state" or the dictatorship of the proletariat. The
former is a prerequisite for the latter.

What characteristics should the new state apparatus
created by the proletariat have? Marx answered this
question by synthesizing the lessons of the Paris Commune:

1. The substitution of the bourgeois centralist form in which
the state was above the nation, by a centralist form of a new
type, in which there is the real and conscious democratic
participation of the proletariat, and which has as a
territorial base the whole commune.
2. The substitution of
the standing army by the armed people
3. The transformation of the police into an instrument at the
service of the commune, stripping it of its former political
attributes. 
4. Representatives of the people elected by
universal suffrage and re-callable at any time. 
5. The suppression of those privileges linked to public office (a
salary equal to that of a worker) 
6. The destruction of bourgeois parliamentarianism, transforming the
representative institutions of the people into "labor
legislative and executive corporations all at the same time."

When Lenin refers to the destruction of the bourgeois
state apparatus, he insists that its annihilation does not have
the character of extinction but of its sudden disappearance
through a revolutionary process.

The bourgeois state "cannot be replaced by the
proletarian state [the dictatorship of the proletariat]
through 'extinction' but only, as a general rule[^7.11] through
violent revolution."

And when Lenin refers to the bourgeois state apparatus to
be destroyed, he is thinking at the same time, of the military
and the bureaucratic apparatus, as is very clear in *The State
and Revolution*.

It is interesting to consider this point for a moment, since
the position which Lenin held in 1917 was modified in an
important way through the passage of time, at least the part
that referred to the bureaucratic apparatus of the State.

In 1917, Lenin believed that the material conditions
existed to be able to destroy the bureaucratic apparatus and
realize, in its place, the ideals of the Paris Commune. In 1921
he had to recognize that things were not so easy, that they
had to resort to the old bureaucrats, and, in order to do that,
they had to put aside the ideas of a salary equivalent to a
worker and of recall.

Thus, before looking directly at Lenin's works in this era,
we want to mention that it seems to us what is essential in the Marxist
thesis is in the necessity of the destruction of the bourgeois state
apparatus. But the creation of a new proletarian apparatus does not
seem to be a task that can be completed immediately, although
the proletariat ought to focus its efforts towards this goal.

In 1921 Lenin said:

> Ours are class courts directed against the bourgeoisie.
  Ours is a class army directed against the bourgeoisie. The
  evils of bureaucracy are not in the army, but in the
  institutions serving it.[^7.12]

Let us examine more closely what happened in this sector
of the state in that epoch:

> We took over the old machinery of state and that was our
  misfortune. Very often this machinery operates against
  us. In 1917 after we seized power, the government
  officials sabotaged us. This frightened us very much and
  we pleaded: 'Please come back.' They all came back, but
  that was our misfortune. We now have a vast army of
  government employees, but lack sufficiently educated
  forces to exercise real control over them. In practice it
  often happens that here at the top, where we exercise
  political power, the machine functions somehow; but,
  down below, government employees have arbitrary
  control and they often exercise it in such a way as to
  counteract our measures. At the top, we have, I don't
  know how many, but at all events, I think, no more than a
  few thousand, at the outside several tens of thousands of
  our own people. Down below, however, there are
  hundreds of thousands of old officials whom we got from
  the tsar and from bourgeois society and who, partly
  deliberately and partly unwittingly, work against us. It is
  clear that nothing can be done in that respect overnight.
  It will take many years of hard work to improve the
  machinery, to remodel it, and to enlist new forces. We are
  doing this fairly quickly, perhaps too quickly. Soviet
  schools and Workers' Faculties have been formed; a few
  hundred thousand young people are studying; they are
  studying too fast perhaps, but at all events, a start has
  been made, and I think this work will bear fruit. If we do
  not work too hurriedly we shall, in a few years time, have
  a large body of young people capable of thoroughly
  overhauling our state apparatus.[^7.13]

V. Types of States and Forms of Government

The State as the totality of the institutions and norms is
designed to regulate the functioning of society in such a way
that it permits the constant reproduction of the economic,
ideological, and juridico-political conditions which assure
the reproduction of the relations of domination of one class
over the rest.

Thus, the character of the state will vary according to the
character of the relations of production. What determines,
therefore, the *type of State* is the economic structure on
which the state is built in the political superstructure. In this
way we can distinguish different types of states in relation to
the different relations of production: slave, feudal,
capitalist, etc.

Within the framework of each of these types of States
different forms of government can be found; for example,
within the capitalist or bourgeois type of state there can be
forms of government which range from republican
"democracy" to military dictatorship.

Thus, since the type of state depends on the economic
structure of the society -- i.e., on the class nature of the
State -- the forms of government depend on concrete,
historical conditions.

Every person or group which operates within the narrow
margins of the dominant ideology in a capitalist society, will
tend to displace the problem of the nature of the state onto
that of the forms of government, and in this way the class
nature of the state, which is the essential and decisive
problem, is hidden.

## Economic Power and Political Power

Frequently too strong a parallel is drawn between the
hierarchy of power in the economic structure, on the one
hand, and the hierarchy of the juridico-political structure on
the other, as if the political power structure were limited to
reflecting the economic power structure; as if the same
classes always occupy the same places in both structures.

This is undoubtedly true as a general tendency. It is also
correct in the long run, since an important and prolonged
contradiction between the two hierarchies would make the
situation untenable. But the concrete reality of history does
not coincide with this oversimplified and schematic
formula.

A typical case of the non-correspondence between
economic and political power took place in France during
the dictatorship of Louis Bonaparte. In this period the
bourgeoisie, which occupied a dominant place in the
economic structure, had to yield its place in the political
structure in order to conserve its dominant position in the
social structure, based, precisely, on its position within the
economic structure.

> Thus by now stigmatising as "socialistic" what it had
  previously extolled as "liberal," the bourgeoisie confesses
  that its own interests dictate that it should be delivered
  from the danger of its own rule; that to restore tranquility
  in the country its bourgeois parliament must, first of all,
  be given its quietus; that to preserve its social power
  intact its political power must be broken; that the
  individual bourgeois can continue to exploit the other
  classes and to enjoy undisturbed property, family,
  religion and order only on the condition that their class
  be condemned along with the other classes to like
  political nullity; that in order to save its purse it must
  forfeit the crown[^7.14]

Another typical case of non-correspondence between
economic and political power is that of Germany in the
modern epoch. The bourgeoisie was so frightened by the
political importance which the proletariat had acquired
that, in order to maintain its economic domination, it
preferred to leave the Junkers, the feudal landlords, in their
position of power. In this sense we have, therefore, feudal-absolutist
political power which carries out an economic
policy that serves the interests of the bourgeoisie.

## The State in Capitalist Society[^7.15]

In appearance the State does not intervene in capitalist
exploitation, but rather it seems to let it develop according
to its own laws. Further, it seems that the state could
intervene by means of legislation in order to limit this
exploitation. The idea of the State being above the classes
finds support in the structure of the capitalist system
of production, where the state does not intervene *directly* in
exploitation. "Peaceful" exploitation is accomplished
through the peaceful act of buying and selling: the labor
contract.

Thus exploitation is managed without the intervention of
state pressure. The individual relation of equality and liberty
in the contractual act of buying and selling labor power
becomes possible thanks to the prior dependence of the
working class on the capitalist class, because of the
separation of the worker from his means of production and
their concentration in the hands of the capitalists. Individual
liberty has as its basis the maintenance of the status quo with
regard to the working class, which is obliged to accept the
conditions which capital imposes upon it.

The invisible threads which tie the working class to the
private property of the capitalist class would not hold up if
the state did not guarantee that property, and with it, the
freedom of capital. In this way the state preserves the general
conditions of existence of the capitalist system of
production, anticipating and repressing attempts against its
freedom thanks to its army of civil servants in the juridico-political
apparatus, and in the last instance thanks to its
armed forces. Once the separation of the worker from his
means of production is assured, the preservation of the
general conditions of the capitalist mode of production
necessitates the use of violent repression only in cases where
violations of the right of private property occur, which feeds
the illusion that the State does not participate in
exploitation.

However,
1. In all those places where capitalism is little developed
    and where the workers are not separated from their means of
    production, to a great degree the State places itself directly
    at the service of capital to help exploit the workers (e.g., the
    Congo, English capitalism in India).
2. The non-intervention in direct exploitation appears as
    it really is -- a permanent, repressive intervention to guarantee the
    conditions of exploitation -- every time that the freedom of
    exploitation, guaranteed by capitalist ownership, is found to
    be threatened by the workers' struggle, every time that the
    free act of purchase and sale which assures the continuation
    of exploitation is threatened by a strike, or every time the
    workers try to secure for themselves control over production
    by occupying factories or land. Then the repressive judicial
    apparatus and the army of the state intervene. All those
    conflicts which threaten the capitalists' free disposition of
    the means of production unleash the intervention of the
    state in one way or another.

The capitalist class and its apologists try hard to convince
us to believe in a new capitalism which has overcome its
infantile disorder, anarchy of production. They try in vain to
convince us of a new discipline, acquired thanks to
fundamental reforms of the structure and to the new rule
which the State plays in regularizing the cycles of capital. At
the bottom of all these reformist illusions rests the idea that
capitalist anarchy has ended, that the needs of society will
prevail over the course of development. Finally, a central
subject has appeared: the state which directs and regulates
development, imposing the viewpoint of social necessity.

The bourgeois interpretation unilaterally places the
accent on the socialization of the productive forces: if
competition brings with it the centralization of capital, the
elimination of the small by the large and the progressive
socialization of the different branches of the economy, why
cannot the same thing happen for the whole society? Are we
not approaching the existence of one single trust, of one
gigantic enterprise including every branch of production?

The general response to this illusion is that *unequal
development is the absolute law of capitalist development*.

Capitalism lives by unequal development. It only
reabsorbs one inequality in order to create another. It
develops the productive forces in one branch in order to take
advantage of the low level of development of the adjacent
enterprises. It socializes an entire branch in order to take
advantage of the relative weakness of the branches from
which it buys or to which it sells. According to the apologists
of neo-capitalism, the appearance of gigantic enterprises
which dominate the market has been a decisive factor in the
planning of production and the elimination of crises. They
do not see that if one enterprise succeeds in eliminating all its
competitors and achieves a monopoly position, the
development of the productive forces thereby realized does
not serve to satisfy social necessities to the fullest by
lowering prices as much as the low costs of production
would allow. The monopoly position which they have
achieved allows them to impose prices which permit them to
make superprofits. In this struggle for the domination of the
market, each capitalist force which seeks to achieve a
monopoly constructs gigantic factories capable by
themselves of supplying the market. That force which is able
to obtain the lowest production costs and flood the market
with the lowest prices wins the dominant position. The result
is a considerable excess of unused production capacity, each
giant company being able to supply the market on its own. This
unused capacity is over 50% in the United States.
The initial cost of over-equipping is amply compensated for
by the monopoly prices acquired after victory.

Another monopoly strategy is possible when one
company in one branch of industry succeeds in obtaining  better production methods than
its competitors for a significant period of time. For example, by monopolizing patents.

On the other hand, the monopolies which live on unequal
development have an interest in letting weaker businesses
survive alongside them. In this way when the state wants to
fix prices, it must take into account the highest cost of
production of these companies if it does not want to force
them to disappear. The monopoly enterprise thus gains a
superprofit, since its costs of production are lower than
these other companies.

Therefore, the socialization of the productive forces and
the knowledge of the market tend to reinforce the
inequalities of capitalist development by stabilizing
superprofits.

Under these conditions, how absurd the idea of
social planning (that is, equal development) under a
capitalist regime seems.

In fact, the most powerful capitals always seek not the
normal profit but superprofits. Only the absolute equality of
profits for all individual capitals would permit us to think, without
being utopian, about a rational distribution of capital
according to a plan. Clearly the law of capitalist
development is inequality: different profits appeared in
different branches during the era of free competition; the
current transformation of the capitalist structure, that is, the
socialization of the productive forces, and the development
of monopolies, mass production, financial centralization,
the increasing application of science to production, now
permit, not in a transient way, but for long periods, the
achievement of positions of superprofits.

Capitalism, in the course of its development, has had to
invent means to adapt its structures to the development of
the productive forces. In this way, when the level of the
productive forces make individual or family capital
insufficient to put the productive forces in action, the
narrow framework of individual ownership was enlarged
through stock companies and replaced by the collective
ownership of the capitalists. In the same way, today state
ownership allows for such an adaptation which, nevertheless,
does not go beyond the limits of capitalist relations. If
the gigantic productive forces cannot be exploited with a
normal profit, then measures for nationalization tend to
intervene. Those sectors of a higher organic composition of
capital are nationalized in such a way that the equality of the
rate of profit is realized among capitals of a lower organic
composition, which results in a higher rate of profit.

On the other hand, the nationalized spheres -- energy,
transportation, etc., -- serve all the capitalist branches of
production. Consequently, the capitalists have an objective
interest that production in these spheres be abundant,
regular, and cheap.

The purpose of such an intervention by the state is not to
subject capital to a centralized direction, but to liberate its
initiative even more, strengthening its autonomy to allow it
to continue its search for maximum profits.

State capitalism, taken in its narrow sense of the
nationalized sector, can, if it is abstracted from the relations
it maintains with the rest of capitalism, give the illusion of
being an embryo of a socialist sector. But in fact, State capitalism
stands for a reality that includes in the same structure
both the private capitalist sector and the state capitalist
sector.

The nationalized sector, by the special function which it
performs in present day capitalism, permits capital to take
advantage of the social character of the productive forces,
while nonetheless remaining within the limits of the
capitalist mode of production.

State monopoly capitalism is not a socialist system of
production which develops in the heart of a capitalist system
of production, but is the actual form taken by the
subordination of the State to the interests of capital.

Only knowledge of the general laws of the capitalist mode
of production permits us to determine the exact limits within
which variations can exist. The general laws fix the limits
and it is, in the last instance, the repressive apparatus of the
state that defends their being made manifest. Within these limits
extends the field of bourgeois politics whose purpose is to
play on all the possible variations within these limits, in
order to maintain these very limits, to keep the
confrontation of the classes within these limits. The politics
of the proletariat, on the contrary, consist in accumulating
forces in the struggle in order to prepare the conditions for
the abolition of those limits imposed by the dictatorship
of capital.

For example, the struggle for the limitation of the work
day does not put into question the fundamentals of exploitation; it
is inscribed, therefore, within the limits fixed by the laws of
this system of production. Within these limits extends the
field of politics which the bourgeoisie can accept. The state
can intervene to sanction and stabilize a relation of forces.
When the working class was weak and disorganized, the
state intervened to prolong the work day through harsh
legislation. When the working class became stronger, the
capitalist class yielded and the state enacted legislation to
limit the work day.

If the state can, thus, impose upon capital the point of
view of society's interests in the form of a law, it is
because this intervention takes place within limits
acceptable to the system of production. In no way could it
impose the point of view of society if it clashed with the
fundamental laws of capital. For example, to impose equal
development depriving capital of all freedom of movement.

Nonetheless, before finishing this section, it seems
important for us to point out that although the
achievements of the working class are enclosed within the
framework of the capitalist system, they do create greater
and greater contradiction, and therefore prepare the
material and political conditions for its disappearance.

## The State in Transition from Capitalism to Socialism: The Dictatorship of the Proletariat

We have seen here that one of the fundamental theses of
Marxism in respect to the state is the necessity for the
revolutionary proletariat, when it seizes state power, to
destroy the bourgeois state apparatus and to create a new
type of state apparatus, some of whose characteristics we
noted when studying the Paris Commune.

What should be the character of this state? What is it that
essentially defines it, from the class point of view?

Before answering this question, let us briefly look at the
general situation of the proletariat in the transition from
capitalism to socialism, since on this will depend, to a large
degree, the character that this new State ought to take.

During the transition from capitalism to socialism social
classes still exist and, therefore, the class struggle has not
disappeared but has taken other forms. The proletariat has
become the ruling class, but its weakness is still very great.

This weakness is found fundamentally at two levels: 1)
that of the economic infrastructure, 2) that of the ideological
superstructure.

l. *The weakness at the level of the infrastructure* has its
    roots in the non-correspondence between the new socialist
    relations of production established in the most important
    sectors of the economy and the technical relations of
    production which are still somewhat backward. The social
    ownership of the means of production is not accompanied
    by a real appropriation of these means in a collective form;
    certain technicians and administrators formed in the former
    regime continue directing production. The essential
    problem of socialist construction, on the level of the
    economic infrastructure, is to resolve this contradiction.

    While socialist relations of production have not been
    established in all the sectors of the economy and while the
    contradiction between social ownership and real collective
    appropriation has not been resolved (it will only be resolved
    by achieving a powerful development of the productive
    forces) the risks of the restoration of capitalism, of
    regressing towards the former regime continue to exist. The
    period of transition is, therefore, a period of merciless
    struggle to definitively implant socialism.
2. *Weakness on the level of the ideological superstructure*.
    Given the economic situation described by Lenin in the
    previous quotation, a struggle is renewed between two
    roads: socialism and capitalism. This struggle, which has an
    economic base, exists, above all, at the ideological level. The
    classes which have been dispossessed of a large degree of
    their economic power seek another front for the struggle: the
    ideological front. They try in thousands of ways to infiltrate
    their ideas into the new social organization. The weakness of
    the proletariat in the ideological field is very great. The
    weight of tradition and of the customs of many generations
    cannot be changed overnight. In the same way that it is
    necessary to carry out a political revolution to seize State
    power, and an economic revolution to change the relations
    of production from capitalist to socialist, it is necessary to
    make a revolution on the ideological level. And in order that
    this revolution be truly effective, it must be realized with the
    participation of the masses; it is not enough to revolutionize
    the ideology of some intellectuals and artists; it is necessary
    that the entire people struggle against the old habits and
    individuals and selfish ideas bequeathed by the capitalist
    regime in order to acquire a new conception of the world: the
    socialist conception and the new habits of solidarity and
    collective cooperation.

In the text which follows, Lenin correctly defines the
essence of the dictatorship of the proletariat tarting with
the task that arise to eliminate these two kinds of
weaknesses:

> But the essence of proletarian dictatorship is not in force
> alone, or even mainly in force. Its chief feature is the
> organisation and discipline of the advanced contingent of
> the working people, of their vanguard; of their sole
> leader, the proletariat, whose object is to build socialism,
> abolish the division of society into classes, make all
> members of society working people, and remove the basis
> for all exploitation of man by man. This object cannot be
> achieved at one stroke. It requires a fairly long period of
> transition from capitalism to socialism, because
> reorganization of production is a difficult matter,
> because radical changes in all spheres of life need time,
> and because the enormous force of habit of running
> things in a petty-bourgeois and bourgeois way can only
> be overcome by a long and stubborn struggle. That is why
> Marx spoke of an entire period of the dictatorship of the
> proletariat as the period of transition from capitalism to
> socialism.[^7.16]

Thus, since the proletariat to complete these tasks, is
faced with a fierce opposition from the bourgeoisie, the
proletarian state must necessarily take the form of a
dictatorship against the classes which are opposed to the
construction of socialism:

> The dictatorship of the proletariat is the most
> determined and most ruthless war waged by the new class
> against a *more powerful* enemy, against the bourgeoisie,
> whose resistance is increased *tenfold* by its overthrow
> (even though only in one country) and whose power lies.
> not only in the strength of international capital, in the
> strength and durability of the international connection
> of the bourgeoisie, but also in the *force of habit*, in the
> strength of *small production*. For, unfortunately, very,
> a lot of small production still remains in the world,
> and small production *engenders* capitalism and the
> bourgeoisie continuously, daily, hourly, spontaneously,
> and on a mass scale. For all these reasons the dictatorship
> of the proletariat is necessary, and victory over the
> bourgeoisie is impossible without a long, stubborn and
> desperate war of life and death, a war which requires
> perseverance, discipline, firmness, indomitableness and
> unity of will.[^11.17]

But this dictatorship against a privileged minority is a
*democracy for the majority of the people*. How could the
measures suggested by Marx after the experience of the
Paris Commune not have an essentially democratic
character?

*Bourgeois democracy* is a democracy for a minority and a
*dictatorship for the majority of the people*. It is now
transformed into a democracy for the majority and
dictatorship for the small group which does not accept
giving up its privileges.

The proletariat would prefer to create socialism under a
regime of absolute democracy for everyone, but the reality
of the clas struggle, the character it necc arily takes when
the proletariat proposes to destroy the privileges of the
ruling classes, makes this dictatorship necessary.
One of the important contributions Marx makes to the
26
theory of history is to have shown _this necessity in a very
clear way.
In the following text Lenin demonstrates the role which
the dictatorship of the proletariat plays in Marxist theory.
It is often said and written that the main point in
Marx's theory is the class struggle. But this is wrong. And
this wrong notion very often results in an opportunist
distortion of Marxism and its falsification in a spirit
acceptable to the bourgeoisie. For the theory of the class
truggle was created not by Marx, but by the bourgeoisie
be.fore Marx and generally peaking it is acceptable to
the bourgeoisie. Those who recognise only the cla
struggle are not yet Marxists; they may be found to be
still within the bounds of bourgeois thinking and
bourgeois politics. To confine Marxism to the theory of
the class struggle means curtailing Marxism, distorting it,
reducing it to something acceptable to the bourgeoisie. A
Marxist is solely someone who extends the recognition of
the class struggle to the recognition of the dictatorship of
the proletariat. This is what constitutes the most
profound distinction between the Marxist and the
ordinary petty (as well as big) bourgeois. This is the
touchstone on which the real understanding and
recognition of Marxism should be tested. 18
In conclusion, we want to say that, to the same degree that
there exists different forms of the bourgeois state, the
essence of which remains the same: a dictatorship of the
bourgeoisie, in the same manner the transition from
capitalism to socialism can produce different forms of the
proletarian state, but its essence will remain the same: the
disctatorship of the proletariat.
Summary
In thi chapter we have defined what is meant by the
juridical-political ·tructure then we analyzed the most
important institution of this le el in a eta s ociety: the tate.
We have seen that it is neces ary 10 di tingui h two state
function : the technical function and that of political cla s
domination. We have looked at the difference between the
state apparatus and political power, between the destruction
and the extinction of the state, between different kinds of
tates and forms of government. We have pointed out that
political and economic power d not alway coincide.
Finally we have concentrated on the analysis of certain
a ·pects of the pre ent-day capitalist tate and on the
fundamental characteristic of the dictator hip of the
proletariat. In thi chapter we have seen the following
concepts of historical materialism: juridico-political
apparatus state apparatu political power, the withering
away of the state, the de tru tion of the ·tale, the
dictator. hip of the proletariat.
