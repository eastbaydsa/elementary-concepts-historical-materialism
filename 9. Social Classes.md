1. Introduction
Marx died before he was able to write the chapter of
Capital dedicated precisely, to this topic. Many authors
have tried to reconstruct it, but the methods used have not
always been the best ones. Here -we shall cite only one of
them: Dahrendorf who in his book Class and Class Conflict
in Industrial Society, tries to reconstruct the last chapter of
Capital in the form of a compendium of quotations from
different texts of Marx, which belonged to different periods
of his theoretical development and which were articulated at
different levels of abstraction. These are then arranged
according to a pre-conceived scheme. His effort is valuable
as a presentation of quotations, but as a contribution to the
understanding of the marxist "problematic" about social
classes it is absolutely worthless.
The correct approach is not to construct the missing
concepts through a c·ompilation of quotations or a selection
of the best of them, but to try to construct them through an
understanding of the problematic on which they are based
which i found, fundamentalJy, in Capital. This is the
approach that we have followed.
The concept of social class is a concept which can be
defined on an abstract level: at the level of the mode of
production, but for it to be an instrument of political
analysis it must be concretized, studying the new
determinations which it acquires in a concrete social
formation and in a given political conjuncture.
We shall first define the concept of social class at the level
of the mode of production and then proceed to the
particular determinations it acquires at the level of social
formation and political conjuncture.
2. Social Classes and Mode of Production
In every mode of production in which relations of
exploitation exist we find two antagonistic social groups:
the exploiters and the exploited: slaves and masters, serfs
and feudal lord , workers and bosse .
The existence of these classes or antagonistic groups was
not discovered by Marx; many historians and economists
had already spoken of them before him.
Marx wrote to J. Weydemeyer on March 5, 1852:
... And now as to myself, no credit is due to me for
discovering the ex.istence of classes in modern society,
nor yet the struggle between them. Long before me
bourgeois historians had described the historical
development of this struggle of the classes, and bourgeois
economists the economic anatomy of the classes. What I
did that was new was to prove: 1) that the existence of
classes is only bound up with particular historical phases
in the development of production; 2) that the class
struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the
proletariat; 3) that this dictatorship itself only consitutes
Lhe transition to the abolition of aJI classes and to a
classless society. 1
Therefore Marx did not discover classes nor the class
struggle. Economists of the early 19th century, like Smith
and Ricardo, historians like Tierry, Guizot and Niebuhr had
already treated this problem. Marx's point of departure was
the point of arrival of those economists and historians.
In Marx's time historical knowledge, in its most advanced
formi· had already portrayed the succession of
"civilizations," of"political regimes," of cultures, etc., as the
result of the struggle between social groups: slaves and free
citizens; patricians and pJebians; serfs and feudal landlords,
etc.
Therefore, when Marx begins the Communist Man(fesLO
with the celebrated phrase, "The hfatory of all hitherto
existing society is the history of class struggles" he is only
summarizing the conclusions which hi predecessors had
reached. These conclusions constitute the primary material
on which he was to work theoretically in order to construct a
scientific theory of the classes and their struggles.
If we return to the first contribution mentioned by Marx
to Wedemeyer we can ex press it as a linking of the concept
of cla s with the concept of mode of production (historical
phases in the development of production).
In one of the texts most cited by marxists, Lenin defines
the social classes in the following manner:
Classes are large group of people differing from each
other by the place they occupy in a historically
determined system of social production, by their relation
(in most cases fixed and formulated by law) to the means
of production, by their role in the social organi2ation of
labor and consequently, by the dimensions of the share
of social wealth of which they dispose and the mode of
acquiring it. Classes arc groups of people one of which
can appropriate the labor of another owing to the
different places they occupy in a definite system of social
economy. 2
In many other texts Lenin emphasizes the relation which
exists between one's situation in social production or in
relation to the means of production and hi / her social class.
The great contribution of marxism to the study of social
classes has been precisely, to establish this relation.
The marxist definition of social class would, therefore, be
the following:
so JAL CLAS ES are antagonistic social groups in which one
appropriates the labor of the other owing to the different
places which they occupy in the economic structure of a
given mode of production, places which are fundamentally
determined by the specific form in which they are related LO
the means of production.
This specific relation has classically been considered as a
relation of ownership or non-ownership of the means of
production, generally identifying ownership with effective
possession of them. But we have already seen that both
words are not the same, that ownership does not always
coincide with effective possession. This confussion has its
origin in Capital itself, since in the pre-monopolistic,
capitalist mode of production tudied by Marx both
relations coincide in the same person. The capitalist is the
owner of the means of production and "effectively"
possesses them at the same time, since without his
intervention or that of his delegate the complex process of
production cannot proceed. Nevertheless, in the only
section of Capital where Marx refers to pre-capitalist forms
of production, he di tinguishes cleal'iy these two relations:
ownership and effective possession.
The correspondence or non-correspondence of these
relations produces different effects on the different groups
involved. Let us look at two types of effects which can be
produced according to the form in which they combine.
Type I
Type II
16
CLASS A
owner hip and
effective posession
of all
the means of
production.
ownership of
the most important
means of
production: the
land.
CLASS B
non-ownership
nor effective
possession of
them.
possession of
land, ownership
of the inst
rumen ts of
labor, control
of the production
processeffective
possession.
EFFECT
to produce
their means of
subsistence,
class .B must
work for class A
to produce their
means of subsistence
class B
does not need to
work for class A.,
if they do it will
be for extraeconomic
reasons.
ft is precisely the non-corre pondence between the
relations of ownership and effective possession which make
the intervention of extra-economic factors necessary in
order to estabJi h and maintain the relation of exploitation
in the second situatian.
It is furthermore evident that in all forms in which the
direct laborer remains the "posse sor'' of the means of
production and labor conditions necessary for the
production of his own means ofsubsistencc the property
relationship must simultaneously appear as a direct
relation of lordship and servitude, so that the direct
producer is not free .... The direct producer, according to
our a sumption, is to be found here in possession of his
own mean of production, the necessary material labour
conditions required for the realization of hi labor and
the production of his means of subsistence .... Under
such conditions the surplus-labor for the nominal owner
of the land can only be extorted from them by otherthan
economic pressure, whatever the form assumed may be.3
The relations of production, therefore, are the mo l
important element for defining social c1a ses. The character
of the relation between the exploited class and the exploiting
cla s will be defined by the character of these relations of
pr0duction.
The correspondence between legal ownership and real
ownership of the means of production in the capitalist mode
of production, which results in the complete separation of
the worker from their mean of production, is what obliges
the workers to "voluntarily" offer their labor power to the
capitalist in order to survive, making the intervention of
extra-economic factors to produce the e class relations
theoretically unneces ary. This does not mean that these
factor are completely absent. We know that capitalist
relations of production rest on a given juridical conception
of ownership and of the labor contract and on the presence
of an army ready to act in those moments when the class
struggle sharply intensifies as the history of bloody defeats
of the workers' movement proves. To explain this we would
say that, although the superstru.ctural relations are present
in capitalism they only intervene when there is a threat
against the system which otherwise tends to reproduce itself
pontaneously in accord with it own economic laws.
Something quite different occurred in the feudal mode of
production. Here the non-correspondence of the relations of
legal ownership and effective possession determi_nes that the
propertied class (the landlords) must resort to force
tradition, religion, etc., to succeed in reproducing the
relations of exploitation, to keep the serf subjected to its
yoke. It is the character of the relations of production in the
period of transition from capitalism to socialism that, while
ownership of the principal means of production is in the
hands of the proletarian state (that is, the proletariat as the
class represented by the state), the "effective possession" of
these mean is still in the hands of tho e, who by their
previous knowledge are able to operate them (ex-capitalists
who have become administrators the whole gamut of
technician of the former system, and later the new
technician , still brought up with the former mentality)
which make the intervention of extra-economic factors
necessary: both political fact.ors (thi is one of the reasons
for the dictatorship of lhe proletariat) and ideological
factors in order to struAgle again t the habits inherited from
the old system. The extra-economic factors must intervene to
prevent the labor of the workers from being monopolized, in
one way or another, by the group that has effective
possession of the means of production. Only the
development of new production relations and forces
(including the workers and their technical preparation) will
permit the realization of a full possession of the means of
production by the workers, and therefore the suppression of
classes.
Clearly, in order to abolish classes completely, it is not
enough to overthrow the exploiters, the landowners and
capitalists, not enough to abolish their rights of
ownership; it is necessary also to abolish all private
ownership of the means of production, it is necessary to
abolish the distinction between town and country, as well
as the distinction between manual workers and brain
workers. This requires a very long period of time. In
order to achieve this an enormous step forward must be
taken in developing the productive forces; it is necessary
to overcome the resistance (frequently passive, which is
particularly stubborn and particularly difficult to
overcome) of the numerous survivals of small-scale
production; it is necessary to overcome the enormous
force of habit and conservatism which are connected with
these survivals. 4
3. The Capitalist Mode of Production:
Two or Three Classes?
In the previous section it was stated that only two
antagonistsic classes exist in every mode of production.
How do we explain, then, that Marx, in referring to
capitalism in the Preface to the Critique of Political
Economy and in various chapters of Capital speaks of three
classes: capitalists, landlords, and workers?
To be able to respond to this question we must ask
ourselves: at what level of abstraction was Marx speaking
when he referred to these three classes? At the abstract level
of the pure capitalist mode of production or at the more
concrete level of a social formation dominated by
capitalism?
If we rigorously study the texts, we realize that when
Marx speaks of the "three classes" he always refers to
"modern society," to "modern bourgeois society," or to
"modern society based on the capitalist regime," and not to
the capitalist mode of production.
On the other hand, if we examine carefully the chapters on
ground rent which are found in section VI of Capita/III and
especially chapter XXXVII: "Introduction," we see that
Marx studied the problem of rent because "the monopoly of
landed property is an historical premise and continues to
remain the basis of the capitalist mode of production ... "
Therefore Marx was obligated to study rent because it
constitutes a fundamental historical datum in the
constitution of the capitalist mode of production and not
because of some abstract logical necessity.
Lenin tells us that "logically we can quite easily imagine a
purely capitalist organization of agriculture in which private
property in land is entirely absent ... "and therefore without
landlords. s
Now let us look at the most explicit texts of Marx about
the problem of the three classes.
Assuming the capitalist mode of production, then the
capitalist is not only a necessary functionary, but the
dominating functionary in production. The landowner,
on the other hand, is quite superfluous in this mode of
production. Its only requirement is that land should not
be common property, that it should confront the working
class as a condition of production, not belonging to it,
and the purpose is completely fulfilled if it becomes stateproperty,
i.e., if the state draws the rent. The landowner,
such an important functionary in production in the
ancient world and in the Middle Ages, is a useless
super/elation in the industrial world. The radical
bourgeois (with an eye moreover to the suppression of all
other taxes) therefore goes forward theoretically to a
refutation of the private ownership of the land, which, in
the form of state property, he would like to turn into the
common property of the bourgeois class, of capital. But
in practice he lacks the courage, since an attack on one
form of property-a form of the private ownership of a
condition of labour-might cast considerable doubts on
the other form. Besides, the bourgeois has himself
become an owner of land. 6
This other quotation is even more clear.
Capitalist production is based on the antithesis of two
factors, materialised labour and living labour. Capitalist
and wage-labourer are the sole functionaries and factors
of production whose relationship and confrontation arise
from the nature of the capitalist mode of production.
The circumstances under which the capitalist has in
turn to share a part of the surplus-labour or surplus-value
which he has captured, with a third, non-working person,
are only of secondary importance. It is also a fact of
production, that, after the part of the value which is equal
to constant capital is deducted, the entire surplus-value
passes straight from the hands of the worker to those of
the capitalist, with the exception of that part of the value
of the product which is paid out as wages. The capitalist
confronts the worker as the direct owner of the entire
surplus-value, in whatever manner he may later be
sharing it with the money-lending capitalist, landowner,
etc. As James Mill observes, production could therefore
continue undisturbed if the landed proprietor
disappeared and the state took his place. He~the private
l~ndowner-is _not a necessary agent for capitalist production,
although 1t does require that the land should belong
to someone, so long as it is not the worker, but for instance,
the state. Far from being an error on the part of Ricardo
etc., this reduction of the classes participating directly in
production, hence also in the value produced and then in
the products in which this value is embodied, to
capitalists and wage-labourers, and the exclusion of the
landowners (who only enter post festum, as a result of
conditions of ownership of natural forces that have not
grown out of the capitalist mode of prodwtion but have
been passed on to it) is rooted in the nature of the
capitalist mode of production-as distinct from the
feudal, ancient etc. This reduction is an adequate
theoretical expression of the capitalist mode of
production. 7
These texts permit us to conclude that in the capitalist
mode of production as in every mode of production, there
are only two fundamentally antagonistic classes: the
bourgeoisie and the proletariat When Marx speaks of three
classes he was referring not to a pure mode of production
but to a given social formation: modern, English ociety and
others in which the capitalist mode of production is
dominant.

4. Social Classes and the Reproduction of the
Mode of Production
In order to be able to satisfy the consumption needs of the
people who live in a society, the production process of
material goods cannot be paralyzed, nor can it be
interrupted; it must continually reproduce itself. And this
process tends to reproduce itself according to its mode of
production, and it tends to reproduce itself without severing
the social relations of production within which it functions.
For this reason it is important to bring into play the concept
of the reproduction of the mode of production in defining
classes.
Let us look at what Marx says in reference to the capitalist
mode of production:
Capitalist production, therefore, of itself reproduces the
separation between labor power and the means of labor.
It thereby reproduces and perpetuates the condition for
exploiting the laborer. It incessantly forces him to sell his
labor power in order to live, and enables the capitalist to
purchase labor power in order that he may enrich
himself. . . . Capitalist production, therefore, under its
aspect of a continuous connected process, of a process of
reproduction, produces not only commodities, not only
surplus value, but it also produces and reproduces the
capitalist relation; on the one side the capitalist, on the
other the wage laborer. 8
But it is not enough to see the importance of reproduction
in the determination of classes; it is necessary to study the
specific form which this process of reproduction assumes
according to the mode of production.
The reproduction of the capitalist mode of production,
for example, not only implies the reproduction of its two
social classes-capitalists and workers-but also their
reproduction according to a determined tendency: the
numerical strengthening of the working class by the growing
proletarianization of those capitalists unable to withstand
the competition, and, therefore, the numerical diminution
of the capitalist class.
The study of the peasantry as a transitional class from
precapitalist forms to capitalist forms shows us that, on the
contrary, its tendency of development involves a drop in the
number of peasants, some of whom come to form a part of
the capitalist system of production.
It is this dynamic aspect of the functioning of classes,
essential to marxist theory, which many of its followers have
forgotten, transforming the study of classes into a formal,
static study.
5. Social Group, Class and Class Fraction
In the previous pages we have stated that there are only
two antagonistic classes in every mode of production. We
have shown, for example, that the landholding class is not,
in the strict marxist sense, a class of the capitalist mode of
production.
When we say that in every mode of reproduction there are
only two antagonistic classes do we mean that all the
individuals living under a given mode of production must
form part of one of the two antagonistic classes? Not at all.
Not all the individuals of a society, nor even all the social
groups, belong to a definite class.
18
Among all the ociaJ groups that exist in a society, only
the groups that directly participate in the production
process, forming antagonistic poles (exploiters and
exploited) constitute social classes. Other groups exist
which cannot be defined as social classes, either becau eat
the level of production they represent intermediary groups
between the two antagonistic classes, as is the case with
technicians and admini trators, or because they are not
directly linked to production since they serve the institutions
of the superstructure: professors, lawyers, functionaries of
the state apparatus, etc.
On the other hand one must not confuse the concept of
class with the concept of class fraction, which designates
those subgroups into which a class can be broken down. For
example, the bourgeoisie as a class breaks down into the
industrial bourgeoisie, the commercial bourgeoisie, and the
financial bourgeoisie. What matters is to determine the
scientific criterion which enables us to distinguish the
different fractions within a given class.
In Capital Marx shows us the path to be followed to
determining the fractions into which the classes of the
capitalist mode of production can be divided.
In the same way that Marx passes from the abstract
concept of surplus value to the more concrete concepts of
industrial profit, commercial profit, and interest-which are
onJy the developed forms of surplu value, that is, the forms
in which it appear on a more concrete level of analysis of
capital-we should pass from the two classe of the
capitalist mode of production, considered at the level of the
production process of surplus value-capitalists and
workers-to the class fractions which arise in the circulation
process of capital.
Io reality, Marx pursues this method when he analyzes the
developed forms of surplus value: to industrial profit
corresponds the industrial bourgeoisie; to commercial
profit, the commercial bourgeoisie; and to interest, the
financial bourgeoisie.
Does the same thing occur with the analysis of the
proletariat?
Marx is less explicit on this point· this ha led many
Marxist theoreticians to exclude from the concept of the
proletariat people who work in banks and commercial
establishments, who are then considered as "employees" (a
social group which would be embraced by the ambiguous
concept of the "middJe classes").
What is the basic argument of these marxist theoreticians?
According to them, a person can be considered a worker
·only· if he directly produces surplus value, that is, a
"productive" worker. Let us compare Marx's analysis to this
argument. Why does he consider as fractions of the
bourgeoisie representatives of commercial and financial
capital if they do not participate directly in the extraction of
surplus value but only in its realization, that is, in the sale of
the products and the financial operations which enable the
indu trial capitalist to recoup, in the form of money the
capital inve ted in the production process?
By the same logic that one has a "non-productive"
bourgeoisie that is, not directly linked to the production of
surp.lus value-the commercial and financial bourgeoisiesone
aJso has a "non-producing" proletariat corresponding
to each of the e fractions of the bourgeoisie. Let us look at
what Marx says about the commercial wage earner.

The question now arises: What about the commercial
wage workers employed by the commercial capitalist .. ?
In one respect, such a commercial employee is a wageworker
like any other. In the first place, his labor power is
bought with the variable capital of the merchant, not with
the money expended as revenue, and consequently it is
not bought for private service, but for the purpose of
expanding the value of the capital advanced for it. In the
second place, the value of his labor power, and thus his
wages, are determined as those of other wage-workers,
i.e., by the cost of production and reproduction of his
specific labor power not by the product of his labor.
However, we must make the same distinction between
him and the wage-workers direct.ly employed by
industrial capital which exists between the industrial
capital and merchant's capital, and thus between the
industrial capitalist and the merchant. Since the
merchant, as a mere agent of circulation, produces
neither value nor surplus value it follows that the
mercantile workers employed by him in these same
functions cannot directly create surplus value for him.9
Finally let us observe the dynamic of the development of
this fraction of the proletariaf as the capitalist mode of
production reproduces itself in expanded form.
The commercial worker, in the strict sense of the term,
belongs to the better-paid class of wage workers-to
those whose labor is classed as skilled and stands above
average labor. Yet the wage tends to fall, even in relation
to average labor, with the advance of the capitalist mode
of production. This is partly due to the division oflabor
in the office .... Secondly ... the universality of public
education enables capitalists to recruit such laborers
from classes that formerly had no access to such trades
and were accustomed to a lower standard of living.
Moreover, this increases supply and hence competition ..
.. The capitalist increases the number of these laborers
whenever he has more value and profits to realize. The
increase of this labor is always the result, never a cause of
more surplus value. 10
To accept the above idea implies questioning the
theoretical utility which certain marxists have attributed to
the concept of productive labor in the definition of social
classes. If this concept is employed in the sense in which
Marx used it in certain analyses we would be led to the
absurdity of including in the concept of the industrial
proletariat workers ranging from the unskilled up to the
manager of a company, that is, from direct workers who are
exploited in the flesh to those indirect workers who are
nothing more than representatives of the capitalist in the
process of extracting surplus value.
Nonetheless, even if the concept of productive labor is not
adequate to define the two antagonistic classes in the
capitalist mode of production, it is useful, at the political
level, to determine the class and the class fraction capable of
carrying out and directing a socialist revolution. It is the
productive proletariat, the proletariat, characteristic of
advanced capitalism, which, because of its situation in
production (the very organization of complex, collective
labor, level of education, etc.), is the fraction of the
proletariat best prepared to direct a socialist revolution,
which is the vanguard of the proletariat.
6. Class Interest
Before moving to a more concrete level of analysis, to the
level of the historically determined social formation, and
studying, at this level, the new determinations which the
concept of social class acquires there, we shall examine two
concepts frequently used but rarely defined: the concept of
class interest and of class consciousness.
Is class interest the totality of the spontaneous aspirations
of a given social class? Can a strike which is limited to
expressing immediate grievance , without ever calling into
question the capitalist system, be considered the expression
of the class in.terest of the proletariat?
To answer these questions we must first distinguish
between two kinds of interests: immediate, spontaneous
interests, and long-range strategic interests.
Immediate, spontaneous interests are the aspirations
which classes or social groups manifest motivated by the
current problems of their existence. They generally have the
objective of securing a greater immediate well-being, a
larger share in the distribution of social wealth. For
example: the immediate, spontaneous interest of a group of
low-salaried workers is to get an increase in pay to
compensate thei;n for a rise in the cost of living. The
immediate interest of a group of peasants is that their
product be bought as a suitable price. In both cases it is a
question of obtaining a remedy to a current ill, without
seeking the deeper source of the problem: it is important to
keep in mind that these immediate, spontaneous interests
are always influenced by the ruling ideology; it is for this
reason that they never come to call into question the system
itself.
Thus the proletariat, left to its own immediate,
spontaneous interests would not go beyond a purely
reformist struggle: a struggle for better salaries, better
housing, more time off, etc., aspirations with which there is
nothing wrong, but which cannot become the final goal of
the class struggle of the proletariat, since they do not call
into question the system of exploitation itself.
The history of all countries shows that the working class,
exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade
union consciousness, i.e., the conviction that it is
necessary to combine in unions, fight the employers, and
strive to compel the government to pass necessary labor
legislation, etc.11
Therefore:
all worship of the spontaneity of the working class
movement ... means, quite independently of whether he
who belittles that role desires it or not. a strengthening of
the influence of bourgeoi ideology upon the workers. 12
Therefore, the immediate, spontaneous interests cannot be
considered, in the strict sense, class interests.
What, then, is meant by class interests? Let us look at
what Marx says in The Holy Family:
It is not a question of what objective this proletarian or
that occasionally raises, or even the proletariat in its
entirety. Its objective and its historical action are
manifest and irrevocably fixed by its very life situation, as
it is for the entire organization of current bourgeois
society.
Therefore, the long-range, strategic interests are the
interests which arise from the very situation of each class in
the economic structure of the society.
The long-range, strategic interest of the dominant class is
to perpetuate its domination, that of the dominated class is
to destroy the system of domination. The strategic interest
of the proletariat, for example, is to destroy the capitalist
system of production, the origin of its exploited condition,
destroying its foundation; the private ownership of the
means of production.
It is important to point out that, owing to the deforming
influence of the ruling ideology, consciousness of these longrange,
strategic interests cannot arise in a spontaneous way;
it is necessary that the members of the exploited classes learn
to recognize them. The necessity of the penetration of
Marxist-Leninist theory in the workers' movement stems,
precisely, from the inability of the proletariat to recognize
immediately its long-range, strategic interests.
Social-Democracy is the combination of the working
class movement and socialism. Its task is not to serve the
working class movement passively at each of its separate
stages, but to represent the interests of the movement as a
whole, to point out to this movement its ultimate aim and
its political tasks, and to safeguard its political and
ideological independence. Isolated from SocialDemocracy,
the working class movement becomes petty
and inevitably becomes bourgeois. 13
Between the immediate, spontaneous interests and the
strategic, long-range interests which reflect the dialectical
duality of the short range objective and the final objective,
there may be contradictions. For example, the attainment of
high salaries, if it is not accompanied by correct ideological
education, can serve to lull the proletariat to sleep, robbing
it of its energy to struggle for its long-range, strategic
interests, that is, the struggle for the destruction of the
capitalist system and the establishment of the socialist
system. The ruling classes are very well-adept at using these
contradictions to perpetuate their rule.
We can conclude, from the above, that, in the rigorous
sense, only the long-range, strategic interests represent true
CLASS INTERESTS.
On the other hand, it is only by beginning with its
immediate interests that we can succeed in making the
proletariat understand its true class interests.
Lenin was very clear and precise on this point. In order to
lead the proletariat in the political struggle against the
servants of capital,
it is necessary to link it with the definite interests of daily
life .... But if these interests are buried under solely
political demands, understandable only by the
intellectuals, will this not represent a new retreat, a new
limitation of the struggle to the intellectuals alone? 14
Therefore, it is necessary to combat two errors: (I) To
consider as class interests the immediate, spontaneous
aspirations of a class; (2) To forget that it is necessary to
begin with the immediate interests of a class to lead it to
understand its true class interests.
7. Class Consciousness and Class Instinct
The other term that we should define is CLASS
CONSCIOUSNESS.
20
Class consciousness should not be confused with the
psychological consciousness of the individuals who
comprise part of a given class. It-is neither the sum nor the
average of what the individuals of a given class think, feel,
etc., at a given moment.
Class consciousness is directly linked to the concept of
class interest.
An individual or a social group has class consciousness
when it is conscious of its true class interests.
Class consciousness, therefore, is an objective datum
related to an objective.situation: the situation of each class in
social production. This distinguishes it absolutely from
empirical notions, from the psychologically recognizable
and explicable notions which people construct from their
life situation.
Now, there remains one final question: Is class
consciousness something that arises spontaneously?
To respond to this question, we should distinguish first
class consciousness and class instinct.
Every social class, owing to its objective situation within
social production, tends to react in a typical manner. CLASS
INSTINCT is precisely those unconscious sets of reactions,
products of class situation, which are found at the base of all
spontaneous expressions of class.
Class instinct is subjective and spontaneous, class
consciousness objective and rational.
It is Lenin who most frequently employs the term class
instinct.
The peasantry has proletarian "instinct" .... The workers
instinctively aspire to socialism ... it is the instinct of the
exploited which brings them to fraternize at the front ...
etc.
Is there a direct step from instinct to consciousness?
Clearly not, at least in what refers to the exploited classes of
any mode of production.
The dominant ideology interposes itself between instinct
and consciousness, perverting instinct and limiting it to
those manifestations which do not call the system into
question, and for this reason proletarian class
c0nsc10usness is never the mere expression of its situation in
the economic structure of society.
If the proletariat of a given country does not have class
consciousness, but merely a trade unionist consciouness,
this cannot be blamed exclusively on the lack of
development of the objective conditions. Conditions will
never be sufficiently developed for the proletariat to acquire
by itself its class consciousness. The task of the workers'
party consists precisely in "introducing" class consciou ness
into the proletariat, by demon trating it and by helping the
class to be consistent with its true class interests.
8. Social Classes and Social Formation
CLASS STRUCTURE is the relationship of the different classes
and class fractions at different levels (economic, political,
ideological) of a social formation.
This class structure does not constitute a simple
juxtaposition of the classes typical of each of the relations of
production which are found in a social formation, but an
original relationship ( articulation) of these classes which are
thus the sub.iects of long-range, strategy.

In this relationship (articulation) of a certain number of
classes in a given social formation, we always find: one
ruling class or class fraction and the ruled classes or class
fractions.
Class structure at the level of the social formation implies,
in addition to the determinations corresponding to the
combination of the different relations of production which
are the basis of the different antagonistic classes of each
mode of production other determinations which explain
the rise of new classes of a transitory nature. For example,
there is the peasantry (petty agricultural producers) which
arises with the suppression of the regime of production
based on serfdom and which tends to di appear as
capitalism develops in the countryside, the majority being
converted into an agricultural proletariat or emigrating to
the city.
Therefore, in order to make a thorough analysis of the
class structure of a given social formation, we must consider
in addition to the classe typical of the current relations of
production, the transitional classes. At the same time we
should not forget that each of these classes undergoes
modifications as a result of its relationship to the others, and
by playing a dominant or subordinate role in this
relationship.
Let us apply what has been said to a social formation
dominated by capitalism, that is, a social formation in which
the capitalist system of production dominates at the level of
the production of material goods, subordinating in one way
or another the other co-existing modes of production of
material goods as well as serving as the ba e of a political
and ideological structure.
The ruling class in the capitalist mode of production
becomes the class which dominates in the social formation.
It sees to it that its class interests prevail over the interests of
all the other classes. The very character of dominance
produces new determinations which are not present at the
level of the pure mode of production. This ruling class will
have, in effect, to maintain relations of exploitation,
collaboration, political struggle, etc., not only with the
proletariat but also with the other classes of the social
formation. This implies that it must have, in the very heart of
the class structure, new instruments ( economic, political,
and ideological) which permit it to fortify and perpetuate its
domination.
In a social formation dominated by capitalism, the ruling
capitalist class must: reproduce the original relation of
exploitation (capitalist/ proletariat); extend this domination
to other classes or strata of the class structure (capitalist/
petty producer); prevent all interference by or make
alliances with the old dominant clas (landlords/ capitalists).
It is this totality of relations which permit it to reproduce
itself as a ruling class and develop its domination. Let us
look at how these relations are manifested in the three levels
of the social formation.
At the economic level at the effect of the market economy
and the development of the productive forces within
capitalist enterprises, the artisan for example, tends to
disappear, having afforded the capitalist a previous superexploitation.
The peasantry except for some few
exceptions, tends to be transformed into an agricultural
proletariat or to emigrate to the city since their petty
exploitation is no longer profitable in relation to large scale
capitalist exploitation, etc.
On the political level, the necessity arises for a political
intervention in order to reproduce the conditions of
exploitation, something which formally, at the level of pure
mode of production, did not appear to be necessary.
The bourgeoisie, at its rise, want and use the power of the
state to "regulate" wages, i.e., to force them within the
limits suitable for surplus value making, to lengthen the
work day and to keep the laborer himself in the normal
degree of dependence. 15
On the other hand, the domination of one class in the class
structure does not always imply that this same class
dominates politically. Sometimes displacements can be
produced. A class which, by its situation in the economic
structure, dominates in the class structure of a determined
social formation can abandon political power to another
class to conserve its domination in the economic structure,
which in turn determines its domination in the social
structure.
Marx analyzes this phenomenon in The 18th Brumaire of
Louis Napoleon.
Thus, by now stigmatizing as "socialistic" what it had
previously extolled as" liberal," the bourgeoisie confesses
that its own interests dictate that it should be delivered
from the danger of its own rule; that, in order to restore
tranquility in the country, its bourgeois parliament must
first of all, be given its quietus; that in order to preserve its
social power intact, its political power must be broken;
that the individual bourgeois can continue to exploit the
other classes and to enjoy undisturbed property, family,
religion and order only on condition that their class be
condemned along with other classes to like political
nullity; that in order to save its purse, it must forfeit the
crown ... 16
Finally, on the ideological level, the ideology of the ruling
class tends to defend the social order which is nothing more
than the order which has been establi hed to reproduce its
rule. It is not uncommon to observe throughout history that
ideas which had been rejected by the bourgeoisie in a given
epoch, like birth control are accepted and promulgated
year later, to avoid the population explosion which, by
increasing the number of people dissatisfied with the regime
might even get to the point of endangering it.
9. Transitional Classes
TRANSITIONAL CLASSES are the classes which only appear
at the level of the social formation, as the effect of the
disintegration of old relations of product ion and which tend
to decompose as the new relations of production develop.
The petty bourgeoisie, that is, independent, petty
producer (artisan or peasant) is a typical example of a
transitional class.
First, let us look at the agrarian petty bourgeoisie or the
PEASANTRY in the strict sense.
Where historically there has existed a regime of
production based on serfdom, the abolition of the bonds of
servitude has liberated the old serfs, converting them into
more or less independent petty producers. But the
disappearance of serfdom does not happen by chance or the
good will of the "lords,' but by the pressure exerted by
incipient capitalism, which, after a certain degree of urban
development, begins to penetrate the countryside.
Capitalist penetration of the countryside produces a
disintegrating effect on this class which little by little is
transformed into a rural proletariat and a rural bourgeoisie.
The peasantry as a class, therefore, tends to di appear.
Unable to compete with capitalist production in the market,
due to its higher production costs, it either goes to ruin and is
converted into a rural proletariat or emigrates to the city,
except for some rare exception who manage to hold firm
and become rich peasants rising to the ranks of rural
bourgeoisie.
This decomposition of the peasantry is an irreversible
process so long as the capitalist laws of production
dominate. No "desire" to maintain the petty producer can
detain this process but measures-can be taken to diminish its
velocity.
The same thing happens with the small, independent
producers, that is, these producers who are also the owners
of their means of production. The impossibility of
competing with the capitalist enterprises in the market
reduces them, little by little, to the conditions of
proletarians.
Therefore, the petty bourgeoisie (small peasant producers
and artisans who produce in a mercantile economic regime)
does not exi t as a class at the level of a pure mode of
production, but appears as such at the level of the social
formation, as a transitional class which arises from the
disintegration of the relations of production based on
serfdom and tends to disappear as the capitalist relations of
production are extended.
The isolation of its members, due to their independent
form of production, their transitory nature, and their
position between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie
determines their characteristics at the different levels of the
social formation.
From the economic point of view, the petty bourgeoisie is
an exploited class, dominated by the capitalist system, but
precisely due to its isolation, caused by its very conditions of
production, it is locked into this position and this
determined form of exploitation. The petty bourgeoisie
is not in a condition to understand the class character of
this exploitation and of this oppression, which it suffers,
often, no less than the proletariat; it is not in a condition
to understand that the state in bourgeois society cannot
help from being a class state. 17
From an ideological point of view, because of his/her
transitional nature, the petty producer has a dual situation;
he/ she is on the one hand, a progressive element insofar as
he/she represents Liberation from Lhe former regime of
dependency, and on the other a reactionary element as
he/ he struggles to maintain his/ her position as an
independent, petty producer posing obstacles to economic
development.
The intermediate situation which he/ she occupies,
between bosses and workers, makes him/ her fluctuate
between the interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
Moreover, this is the class most susceptible to the ruling
ideology, with which it establishes certain relations that
prevent it from perceiving the objective conditions of its
servitude and of its future destruction.
22
To close, we quote this excellent passage from Lukacs
about the petty bourgeoisie:
This class (petty bourgeoisie) lives at least in part in the
capitalist big city and every aspect of its cx.i tence is
directly ex.posed to' the influence of capitalism. Hence it
cannot possibly remajn wholly unaffected by the/act of
class conflict between bourgeoi ie and proletariat. But as
a 'transitional class in which the interests of two other
classes become simultaneously blunted ... 'it will imagine
itself 'to be above all class antagonisms'. Accordingly it
will seach for ways whereby it will 'not indeed eliminate
the two extremes of capital and wage labour, but will
weaken their antagonism and transform it into harmony'.
In all decisions crucial for society its actions will be
irrelevant and it will be forced to fight for both sides in
turn but always without consciousness. 18
10. Class Situation
In the previous pages we have examined the concept of
social class at two different levels: at the level of the mode of
production and at the level of the social formation, that is, of
an historically determined society.
On both levels the classes are defined by their SITUATION
in the social structure, a situation which depends on the
specific relations which the social groups maintain with the
means of production.
Class situation is, therefore, determined by the place
which individuals occupy in the process of social
production. CLASS SITUATION is the situation which
individuals occupy in the social structure, which is
determined, in the last instance, by the role which they play
in the process of social production.
This concept should not be confused with the concept of
CLASS ORIGIN, which does not refer to the current situation
of the individual in the social structure, but to the class
situation in which this individual was formed; for example,
the class situation of his/ her parents.
Finally, this concept of class situation should not be
confused with the concept of CLASS POSITION, which we shall
develop in the following section.
11. Social Classes and the Political Conjuncture
Our first stage was to define the social classes at the level
of the mode of production; later we defined them at the level
of the social formation. Now we must move to a more
concrete level, the level of the POLITICAL CONJUNCTURE or
"present moment," which constitutes the synthesis of all the
contradictions of a given society in a given moment of its
development. At this level new determinations come into
play, overdetermining the classes defined above.
We shall analyze two of these determinations: the
problem of CLASS POSITION and the difference between class
and SOCIAL FORCE.
a) Class Position
When we studied the social classes at the level of the mode of
production we saw that not alJ the individuals io a society
belong to one of the two antagonistic classes, that social
groups exist which cannot be defined as social classes either
because they represent intermediate groups between the two
antagonistic classes at the level of production or because
they do not participate directly in production, being at the
service of the institutions of the superstructure. These
groups do not constitute classes as such, but they tend to
adopt positions which favor one or the other of the
antagonistic classes.
On the other hand, not all the members of a class defend
the interests of their class in a given political.conjuncture.
For example, the labor aristocracy, the privileged sector of
the working class of the capitalist, imperialist countries in
numerous political conjunctures, have not defended the
interests of the working class, but the interests of the
bourgeoisie.
Therefore, it is not enough to be a member of a class-to
have a determined class situation-to adopt political
attitudes consistent with that class situation.
CLASS POSITION is the" taking of sides" by a class in a given
political conjuncture.
This "taking of sides" by a given class implies defending
and struggling for its class interests, adopting "its point of
view," "joining its ranks," "representing its interests."
Referring, for example, to "the middle strata, the small
industrialist," the petty merchant, the artisan, the peasant,
Marx states that "they are revolutionary only in view of their
impending transfer into the proletariat;" thus they defend
"not their present, but their future interests," they desert
"their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the
proletariat."
Lenin says, on the other hand, that it is not impossible
that, under certain conditions, one or another stratum of
working people could take its place at the side of the
proletariat. Later he shows that the whole problem is to
determine these conditions, and he considers that the words
"to make their own the viewpoint of the proletariat"
precisely express these conditions; that these words trace a
clear line of demarcation between true marxists and all
other groups who claim to be socialists.
In another context, referring to intellectuals, Lenin says
that every intellectual, though he works towards an
objective analysis of reality "cannot fail to take sides with
one side or another class once he/she has understood the
relations that exist between them."
In a text about "The Tasks of the Revolutionary Youth"
he makes it clear that students cannot be considered as a
homogeneous w0hole, since they tend to reflect the interests
of all classes and political groups in society; only some
among them "adopt a revolutionary position," dedicating
themselves to the working class.
In The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte Marx speaks of
the "representatives" of the petty bourgeoisie and the class
itself, who
According to their education and their individual
position may be as far apart as heaven from earth. What
makes them representatives of the petty bourgeoisie is the
fact that in their minds they do not get beyond the limits
which the latter do not get beyond in life, that they are
consequently driven, theoretically, to the same problems
and solutions to which material interest and social
position drive the latter practically. This is, in general, the
relationship between the political and the liteary
represen1a1ives of a class and the class they represent.
Therefore, class position is a concept which belongs to the
analysis of the political conjuncture. It is in the "current
movement" of the political struggle that individuals group
themselves into defined class positions. Obviously the basis
of this class position is class situation, but it is not restricted
to this. Isolated elements or groups belonging to other
classes can join with and struggle for a class which is not
their own.
Class situation creates, as we have seen, a class instinct
which causes the members of that class to tend to take the
side of the class to which they belong.
In order to arrive at a proletarian class position, the class
instinct of a proletariat only needs to be educated; on the
contrary, for the petty bourgeois intellectuals to succeed in
reaching a proletarian class position, their class instinct
must be revolutionized.
Attaining a proletarian class position requires a long
process. Often petty bourgeois intellectuals join the
proletarian party because they have become convinced of
the truth and the political efficacy of marxist analysis, but in
difficult political conjunctures, they fall into petty bourgeois
positions. That is why marxism gives such profound
importance to the social constitution of a proletarian party.
The greater the number of members of the party with a
proletarian class situation, the easier it will be to avoid leftist
or rightist deviations which are the expression of petty
bourgeois ideology in the ranks of the proletariat.
b) Social Forces
Much confusion about the concept of class comes from
certain texts of Marx which have been interpreted in such a
way as to deny the class character of a social group which, in
spite of being in a determined situation in the economic
structure of a social formation, still has not participated in a
unified way in the political struggle.
In other texts Marx does not deny the class character of a
group which has not participated in the political struggle,
but he refers to it as "a class for itself," that is, a class which
participates in the political struggle.
Economic conditions had first transformed the mass of
the people of the country into workers. The domination
of capital has created for this mass a common situation,
common interests. This mass is thus already a class as
against capital, but not yet for itself. 19
It seems to us that the terminology employed by Lenin
and Mao is more adequate; they speak of social class when
they are at the level of the mode of production and the social
formation, and introduce the term SOCIAL FORCE to analyze
the action of these classes at the level of the political
conjuncture.
A s'ocial' group can constitute a class and not a social
force, as for example, the petty, peasant producers of certain
countries.
On the other hand, some social groups can constitute a
social force, as for example, revolutionary intellectuals.
In order for a class or social group to constitute a social
force, it need not be organized into a political party proper,
as apparently has been inferred from some texts of Marx. It
is enough that its existence be reflected in some manner in
the correlation of forces at the level of the conjuncture, that
is, that it produces "pertinent effects" to use Poulantzas'
terminology. This is the case of the small-holding peasants
analyzed by Marx in The 18th Brumaire. In the concrete
conjuncture of Bonapartism, Marx recognizes the role
which the small-holding peasants have played in spite of
their having neither their own organization nor their own
ideology. They constitute a social force, since their existence
as a class is reflected in that concrete c~mjuncture by the
historical phenomenon of Bonapartism, which would not
have existed, were it not for the small-holding peasants.
Louis Bonaparte put himself forward as the
representative of the small-holding peasants although he
was, in reality, the 'representative' of the interests of the
bourgeoisie. Yet it remains the case that the economic
existence of the small-holding peasants is reflected, on
the political level, by the 'pertinent effe~ts' consti!ute~ by
the particular form of state ofBonapartJsm as a h1stoncal
phenomenon. We are faced here with a new but easily
located element, i.e., the particular form of state in the
Second Empire, a form which cannot be inserted in the
framework of the preceding parliamentary state.20
If this had not occurred, if the existence of the peasantry
as a class had not been reflected in the phenomenon of
Bonapartism, this class doubtlessly would have had some
kind of presence on the political level
if only in the simple fact that the political organization of
the other classes, as well as the institutions of the state,
have to take into account the existence of the smallholding
peasants, for example, in the case of suffrage.
However, in this case, this presence neither constitutes a
new element, nor has 'pertinent effects', but is only
inserted as a variation into limits circumscribed by the
pertinent effects of other elements, for example into the
framework of constitutional democracy. 21
In a revolutionary process it is necessary to distinguish
three kinds of forces:
the motor forces
the principal forc_e
the directing force
The motor forces are constituted by the social groups
which actively participate in the revolutionary process.
The principal force is constituted by the social group that
represents the most numerous motor force. .
The directing force is constituted by the social group
which directs the revolutionary process. To direct the
revolutionary process it is not necessary to be the most
numerous motor force. What makes a directing force is not
its members but its political role, that is, its capacity to take
the initiative, formulate adequate goals at each stage and
find the correct forms of leadership. In this way it gains the
confidence of the revolutionary masses who then follow its
directives without wavering.
The example of the Chinese Revolution illustrates very
clearly these three types of forces. The motor forces were
comprised by the peasantry, the proletaria_t, ~nd the ur~an
bourgeoisie; occasionally they succeeded m mcorporatmg
certain sectors of the national bourgeoisie. The principal
force was, doubtlessly, the peasantry, and the proletariat, in
spite of its small numbers, s_ucceed~d in making_i~self the
directing force of the revolutwn, owmg to the pohtical role
which it played in the Chinese Revolution.
It is very important not to confuse the principal force with
the directing force of the revolution.
In certain Latin American countries, for example, the
conditions of extreme misery of the peasantry, its great
24
revolutionary potential and its heavy specific gravity within
the total population of the country, without doubt convert it
into the principal force of the revolution in those countries.
But to state this is nqt to deny to the proletariat its leading
role in the revolutionary process, since it is objectively the
only class which by its class situation, that is, by its situation
in social production. is capable of leading the revolutionary
process to the end, to ihe suppression of every type of
exploitation.
12. Conclusion: The Social Classes as Bearers of
Determined Structures
After what has been said in the above sections we can
understand the relationship which exists between the social
structure and the social classes.
Social classes are not the creative subjects of social
structures. They are, on the contrary, as Marx says, the
"bearers" (Trager) of determined structures, the actors in a
drama they have not written.
Let us consider for a moment this concept of "bearer"
which is what Marx uses in Capital to describe the relation
we wish to study here.
In the first place, we should note that the German word
Trager has two very different meanings in English ( as well as
in Spanish and French): "support" and "bearer." The first
term ( support) indicates the idea of sustaining, of being the
base of something, of serving as the support of something
and in this sense Marx uses it when he states that "the
material conditions are the supports (Trager) of the social
relations."
The second term (bearer) means, on the contrary, to take
on oneself, to bring with you, and in this sense Marx utilizes
it when he states that "the capitalist is nothing more than
capital personified," that "he only acts in the process of
production as the bearer (Trager) of capital."
Marxism, by affirming that the classes are the bearers of
determined structures rejects all voluntaristic conceptions
about the social classes.
It is not the classes that create the structures. It is not
enough, for example, that a class proposes to change a social
structure for it to be able to do it. Although the proletariat
might want to implant communism immediately after
having destroyed capitalism, it could not do so, since this
regime requires as a prior condition for its implantation a
very advanced development of the productive forces.
But to state that it is not the classes which create the
structures, is not to say that they cannot act on the
structures, modifying them within certain limits. These
limits depend on certain material conditions, which form the
basis for the level of development reached by the productive
forces. Without the active participation of the classes, the
social structures tend to reproduce themselves, surmounting
the crises provoked by their internal contradictions. Radical
changes in the social structures only come about when the
revolutionary classes are capable of taking advantage of the
crises of the system to produce profound structural changes,
that is, revolutionary changes. This is what explains the
fundamental role which marxism attributes to the class
struggle as the motor of history.

Returning now to our definition, to say that the classes are
the bearers of determined structures is the same as saying
that they are the effects of these structures.
Thus we can come to define the social classes as the effects
of the total social structure on the individuals who
participate in one way or another in social production.
By this have we abandoned the concept of relations of
production to define the classes?
We think this would be the case if we were to conceive of
the total social structure as a simple relationship among
levels ( economic, ideological, and political), as does
Poulantzas. In this case it is a theoretical impossibility to
study this effect as an effect of a global structure and one is
obliged to analyze it as a series of partial effects at the level of
each regional structure.
On the other hand if the relationship between the different
levels of the social structure is thought by beginning with the
relations ofproduction everything changes. For Marx these
relations are what serve as the structuring center or matrix
of the social whole, as we have seen from studying the
concept of the mode of production. And for this reason it is
these relations which are the basis for the constituting of
social classes. To deny this, qualifying it as an economist
deviation, is to deny the basic contribution of marxism to
the study of the social classes, and it is, therefore, a step
backward in respect to marxist thought.
Finally, we want to clarify that it is one thing to speak of
the classes as effects of the social structure, which finally
only means that they are fundamentally the effect of the
relations of production, and another thing to speak of the
effects which the classes can produce in the different levels of
the society: ideological effects, political effects, or economic
effects. When we refer to these effects, we are referring to the
concrete practice of these classes. This practice will be
studied in the next chapter.
Summary
In this chapter we have referred to the marxist concept of
social class. First we have defined it at the level of the mode
of production in order to later examine the new
determinations which it acquires at the level of the social
formation and the political conjuncture. Lastly we have
clarified the definition of the classes as "bearers" of
determined structures.
We have looked at the following concepts of the general
theory of hi torical materialism: social class, class fraction,
class interest, class consciou ness, class instinct, class
structure, transitional class, class situation, class position,
social force, motor force, principal force, directing force.
