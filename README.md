# The Elementary Concepts of Historical Materialism

This repo contains a translation of Marta Harnecker's "Los conceptos elementales del materialismo hist√≥rico".

Up to chapter 10 is mostly adapted from the translations of individual chapters that appeared in monthly review,
although some changes to language have been made here and there. We have changed most of the pull-quotes from translations of the *Spanish* translations of the originals, to the most popular English translations of the originals.

Chapter 11 is a new translation from the [Spanish original](https://www.proletarios.org/books/Harnecker-Conceptos_elementales_del_materialismo_historico.pdf).

## Rendering for readers

The markdown files are currently compiled to a PDF using pandoc, using Mermaid for flow-chart diagrams,
and postscript for general diagrams. It would be nice to have an epub or website version of the book
as well. Please let me know if you are interested in working on either.

## Contributing fixes

Improvements to this document are very welcome.
If you would like to improve the translation/word-choice, formatting, type-setting, etc., please
create a pull-request on this repo.
