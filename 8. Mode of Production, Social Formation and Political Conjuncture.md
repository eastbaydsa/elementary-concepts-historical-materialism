# Mode of Production, Social Formation and Political Conjuncture

## The Concept of Mode of Production

Now that we have studied the economic, juridico-political,
and ideological levels of society, we can move on to
those elements which will permit us to define the Marxist
concept of mode of production.

Marx and Engels frequently used the expression "mode of
production of material goods" or simply "mode of
production" in order to *describe* the *manner*, the *form*, the
*mode* by which material goods are produced.

Let us look at some texts:

> The mode of production of material life conditions the
  general process of social, political, and intellectual life.
  (Preface to *A Contribution to the Critique of Political
  Economy*)

> It is not what is made but how, and by what instruments
  of labour, that distinguishes different economic epochs.
  (*Capital*)

> At first capital subordinates labour on the basis of the technical
  conditions within which labour has been carried on up to that
  point in history. It does not therefore directly change the mode of
  production. The production of surplus-value in the form we have so
  far considered, by means of simple extension of the working day,
  appeared therefore independently of any change in the mode of
  production itself. (*Capital*)

> The materialist conception of history starts from the
  principle that production, and with production the
  exchange of its products, is the basis of every social order:
  that in every society which has appeared in history the
  distribution of the products, and with it the division of
  society into classes or estates, is determined by what is
  produced and how it is produced, and how the product is
  exchanged. According to this conception, the ultimate
  causes of all social changes and political revolutions are
  to be sought, not in the minds of men, in their increasing
  insight into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the
  mode of production and exchange; they are to be sought
  not in the *philosophy* but in the *economics* of the epoch
  concerned. (Engels, *Anti-Duhring*)

We should not confuse the expression "mode of
production of material goods" with the concept *mode of
production*. The former is a descriptive notion which only
refers to the economic structure of society; the latter, on the
contrary, is a theoretical concept which refers to the entire
social totality, that is, both to the economic structure as well
as to the other levels of the social totality: juridico-political
and ideological.

Marx and Engels never defined the concept of mode of
production which they so often use. The majority of Marxist
writers use this term without defining it; and those who do
define it, limit its significance to the economic level alone.
We think, nevertheless, in accord with Louis Althusser, that
the reduction of this concept to only the economic level
limits the implicit sense which Marx gave it in his most
finished work, *Capital*.

By studying the mode of production of material goods,
that is, what we have called the production process, we have
seen that, from the Marxist point of view, it is not enough to
define it only as a technical process. This technical process
takes place under determined social relations -- the social
relations of production -- which, in the last instance, make the
process possible. Moreover, we have seen that elements of
the superstructure of society enter into the making of these
relations. Without the explicit, or implicit consent of the
members of society and its institutions, these relations could
not remain in force.

Engels affirms this concerning class societies, in the
following text:

> Society thus far, based upon class antagonisms, had need
  of the state, that is, an organization of the exploiting class
  at each period for the maintenance of its external
  conditions of production; that is, therefore, for
  forcible keeping the exploited class in the
  conditions of oppression corresponding with the
  given mode of production (slavery, serfdom,
  wage-labor). (*Anti-Duhring*)

In this text Engels shows the necessity for the existence of
superstructural conditions to maintain a determined kind of
social production.

Let us see now, what Marx says in one of the few explicit
passages in Capital on this question:

> It is evident, however,
  that in the aboriginal and undeveloped conditions on which this
  social relation of production[^8.1] and the mode of production corresponding
  to it are based, tradition must play a predominant role.
  It is also evident here as always that it is in the interest of the
  dominant section of society to sanctify the existing situation as a
  law and to fix the limits given by custom and tradition as legal
  ones. Even ignoring any other factors, this happens automatically
  as soon as the constant reproduction of the basis of the existing
  situation, the relationship underlying it, assumes a regular and
  ordered form in the course of time; and this regulation and order
  is itself an indispensable moment of any mode of production that
  is to become solidly established and free from mere accident or
  caprice. It is precisely the form in which it is socially established,
  and hence the form of its relative emancipation from mere caprice
  and accident. It can attain this form in stagnant conditions of
  both the production process and the social relations corresponding
  to it, simply by reproducing itself repeatedly. (*Capital, Vol. III*)

If tradition and order are "indispensable elements of any
mode of production," as Marx clearly says in this text, this
cannot be defined only as the economic structure of society,
but includes the entire social totality.

The concept of mode of production is precisely the
concept which gives us a scientific way to think about a
social totality.

There is a great difference between *describing* -- pointing
out its visible characteristics -- and *understanding* something.
When a patient tells his doctor what he feels, he only is
describing the symptoms of his illness. The doctor, with his
understanding of the human organism, is able to diagnose a
given illness starting from these symptoms, for example,
appendicitis. He sums up in one word the extensive
description of the symptoms which the patient makes. This
word implies a *understanding* of the illness. The application of
the understanding is what enables him to cure the patient. In
order to properly diagnose a given illness, it is necessary to
grasp the unity which enables one to understand the
different symptoms. Likewise, in order to define an object --
understand it -- it is necessary to discover the unity, or the
form of organization of the elements which first served to
describe it.

It is possible to describe a society; to say for example, that
in every society there are industries, cultivated land, post
offices, schools, an army, police, laws, ideological currents,
etc. But the organization of these elements in different
structures (economic, juridico-political, and ideological)
and the determination of the role which each one of these
structures plays in the society, permits us to pass from *the
description* to *the understanding* of a social reality, to
establish its laws of development and, therefore, the
possibility of consciously guiding it. In Marx's time
everyone *perceived* and *described* the symptoms of
the "capitalist sickness": the poverty of the masses, the wealth of
certain small groups, the exploitation of women and
children, etc. Some rebelled; others sought to explain this
situation by returning to fatalistic, divine laws: "there have
always been poor people and there always will be." But
Marx and Engels knew how to advance from the description
to an understanding of the causes and the laws of capitalist
development, an understanding which later permitted Marxist
parties to make revolution and establish new social systems.

From what has been said above, it is possible to better
understand the statement we have made: the concept of
*mode of production* is the theoretical concept which gives us the ability
to think about the social totality.

Every mode of production is defined by:

1. A global structure formed by three regional structures: the economic
  structure, the juridico-political structure (laws, the state,
  etc.), the ideological structure (ideas, customs, etc.).
2. One of the regional structures within this global structures which dominates the others.

    It is important to point out here that it is not always the
    economic level or structure which plays the dominant role,
    as those who vulgarize Marxism frequently claim. Marx
    clearly tells us this in a footnote in the first volume of
    *Capital*:

    > I seize this opportunity of briefly refuting an objection made by a German-American publication to my work *Zur Kritik der
      Politischen Okonomie*, 1859. My view is that each particular mode of production,
      and the relations of production corresponding to it at each given moment,
      in short 'the economic structure of society', is 'the real foundation, on which
      arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite
      forms of social consciousness', and that 'the mode of production of material
      life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life.'
      In the opinion of the German-American publication this is all very true for
      our own times, in which material interests are preponderant, but not for the
      Middle Ages, dominated by Catholicism, nor for Athens and Rome, dominated
      by politics. In the first place, it strikes us as odd that anyone should sup-
      pose that these well-worn phrases about the Middle Ages and the ancient world
      were unknown to anyone else. One thing is clear: the Middle Ages could not
      live on Catholicism, nor could the ancient world on politics. On the contrary,
      it is the manner in which they gained their livelihood which explains why in one
      case politics, in the other case Catholicism, played the chief part. (*Capital*)

    If we sum up the essentials of the note, we can see that
    Marx held that if economics dominates in capitalism, we
    cannot deny that in the middle ages Catholicism dominated
    (that is to say, an ideological structure) and in Athens and
    Rome it was politics which was dominant. But he says: "it is
    the manner in which they gained their livelihood that explains"
    why here politics and there Catholicism played the chief (or
    dominant) role.

3. In this global structure, the economic structure is always *determinant* in the last instance.

    As the text we have just cited indicates, it is the economic
    conditions which determine which of the regional structures
    will have the dominant role.

    The distinction between the *dominant* and *determinant*
    role in the last instance is a fundamental distinction which
    must be made, and to which Althusser has given full weight.
    It is difficult to find explicit formulations about this
    distinction in Marx and Engels since the object of their study
    was the capitalist mode of production in which both
    determinants coincide. In this mode of production
    economics plays not only the determinant role in the last
    instance, but also the dominant role.

    Let us define more precisely what we mean by a dominant
    structure. At the level of the mode of production we
    consider as dominant that regional structure which plays the
    fundamental role in the reproduction of a given mode of
    production.

    In the case of the capitalist mode of production, its
    reproduction is assured by laws internal to the economic
    structure. This does not mean that superstructural elements
    are absent, but that their presence is not the fundamental
    element in the reproduction of the system. The laws of
    capitalist economic development (accumulation, extended
    reproduction, etc.) determine the form in which the system
    reproduces itself and give it its specific character. The
    superstructural factors, only intervene manifestly when
    obstacles arise which block the unfolding of these laws. This
    knowledge permits us to affirm that in the capitalist mode of
    production it is the economic structure which occupies the
    dominant place within the global structure of the mode of
    production.

    In the case of the feudal mode of production, it is not the
    economic laws which assure the reproduction of the system.
    In order that the surplus continue to be appropriated by the
    landlords, the active and fundamental intervention of
    superstructural elements is required. Without a
    fundamental relationship of dependence linked to
    ideological and juridico-political factor, the serfs would not
    work the land of the lord, nor would they turn over a part of
    their labor in other forms of rent (in kind or in money). In
    this mode of production therefore, it is the ideological or
    juridico-political superstructure which is dominant, since it
    is through them that the reproduction of the mode of
    production is assured.

4. Finally, what characterizes every *mode of production*
    is its dynamism, that is, the continuous reproduction of its
    conditions of existence. The capitalist mode of production,
    for example, at the same time that it reproduces material
    goods in a form which requires the division of labor in that
    social totality into capitalists and workers, and which
    creates an entire ideology that favors this kind of production
    and a form of power that defend and stimulates it, also
    continuously reproduces its conditions of reproduction.

    At the same time that it produces material goods, it
    reproduces capitalist relations of production. And at the
    same time that it reproduces these relations, it reproduces its
    superstructural condition of existence; that is, the
    ideological conditions and the power relations, as well as the
    role that they play within the social structure.

***Mode of production*** is the theoretical concept which
gives us the ability to think about the social totality as a "structure in
dominance", in which the economic level is determinant in
the last instance[^8.2].

To conclude, we must insist that the structural nucleus or
matrix of the mode of production is the relations of
production. These relations explain the characteristic type
of articulation of the different regional structures in each
mode of production; they determine which of the structures
will occupy the dominant role. Let us recall that Marx
explicitly says that "the direct relationship which exists between
the direct producers and the owners of the means of production"
reveals
to us "the innermost secret, the hidden basis of the entire
social structure."[^8.3]

## The Concept of Social Formation

The concept of *mode of production* refers to an abstract
object, a pure social totality, an "ideal" in which the
production of material goods is carried out in a
homogeneous form. But in the great majority of historically
given societies, the production of material goods is not
carried out in a homogeneous way. In the same society it is
possible to find different kinds of relations of production.

Russia as analyzed by Lenin in his article on "The Tax in
Kind" (which corresponds more or less, to the period
between 1917 and 1929) is an example of the combination of
different economic systems. Let is see how Lenin
enumerated them: 

1. Patriarchal peasant economy. That is
to say, to a great degree, a natural economy
2. Small commodity production. This category includes the majority
of the peasants who sell wheat.
3. Private capitalism.
4. State capitalism.
5. Socialism.

Russia was so large and varied that all these different
economic and social forms were mixed in it. In this consisted
the novelty of the Russian situation.

Another example is France as analyzed by Marx in
*The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon*. There we had the
combination of different modes of production of material
goods: feudal, patriarchal, small commodity, and
capitalist.

These diverse relations of production which co-exist in a
historically given society do not do so in an anarchic
way, nor are they isolated from one another; one of them
occupies a dominant position, imposing on the rest its own laws
of operation.

In the *Introduction to the Critique of Political Economy*
Marx says the following: 

> There is in every social formation a particular branch of production which determines the position and importance of all the others, and the relations obtaining in this branch accordingly determine the relations of all other branches as well.

If we study, for example, the diverse countries of Latin
America we find there diverse relations of production
which range from highly developed capitalist relation to
those which characterize on economy of near autarchy in
certain regions; with capitalist relation of production
dominating in the majority, if not in all of them. The
capitalist relations subject to their law of development the
other relations, which are subordinated to them.

Therefore, in the majority of historically given
societies, we encounter a variety of relations of production. But
in this diversity there is always one set of relations of production
which is dominant and whose laws of operation have a
decisive influence over the rest.

From what has been said above we can deduce that the
domination of a given type of relations of production does
not automatically make all the other relations of production
disappear; these can continue to exist, although modified
and subordinated to the dominant relations of production.

We can point out, for example, that since the epoch of
the *conquista*, the countries of Latin America have been
subjected to the capitalist world system, at first under the
form of commercial capitalism and later through properly
capitalist relations of production (in the majority of
countries). But to say that this capitalist world system
dominates does not deny that there were and still
are, in a very widespread form, pre-capitalist relations of
production: relations of production which approach primitive communism
in some isolated places, semifeudal
relations in many peasant areas, and a quite a large
spread of small, artisan production[^8.4].

Now then, the dominant relations of production not only impose
their laws of operation on the other relations of production
that are subordinated to them, but they also determine the
general character of the superstructure of the given society.

The complexity of the economic structure and the
dominant character of one of the sets of relations of production
that co-exist in it, explains the complex character of the
ideological and juridico-political structures of every
historically given society.

To refer to this historically given social reality, we
use the concept of a *social formation*. This concept refers, as
we have seen, to a concrete, complex, impure reality -- like all
reality. This is in distinction to the concept of *mode of
production* which refers to an abstract, pure, "ideal" object.

A ***social formation*** is a concrete, historically given,
social reality.

This concrete, historically given, social totality can
correspond to a given country, or to a series of countries
which have more or less similar characteristics and a
common history. Thus, we can speak of the Chilean,
Mexican, etc., social formation, as well as the Latin
American social formation.

As with every social totality, this concrete, historically
determined social totality is composed of an economic
structure, an ideological structure, and a juridico-political
structure. But at this level, they have a much more complex
character. Therefore, in every social formation, with very
few exceptions, we find 

1. A *composite economic structure*, in
  which diverse sets of relations of production co-exist. One of these
  sets of relations occupies a dominant place, imposing its laws of
  operation on the other, subordinated sets of relations.
2. A *composite ideological structure* formed by different
  ideological tendencies. The dominant ideological tendency,
  which subordinates and deforms the other tendencies,
  generally corresponds to the ideological tendency of the
  ruling class, that is, to the ideological tendency belonging to
  the exploiting pole of the dominant relation of production;
3. A *composite juridico-political* structure which fulfills the
  function of domination by the ruling class.

The social formation is, therefore, a composite structure,
composed of composite structures in each region which are
articulated starting from the structure of the relations of
production. It is necessary to study each regional structure
in its relative autonomy in relation to the rest and in
accordance with its own characteristics.

The concept of mode of production refers to an abstract
social totality (capitalist, feudal, slave, etc.). The concept of
social formation refers to a concrete social totality. This is
not a combination of modes of production, of abstract or
ideal social totalities; it is a concrete, historically given
reality, structured beginning with the form in which the
different sets of relations of production which co-exist at the level
of the economic structure are combined[^8.5].

Therefore, to study a social formation, to study a given
country, we must always begin by diagnosing what kind of
relations of production exist, how they are combined, what
is the dominant set of relations of production, and how it exercises
its influence over the subordinated relations of production.

We know that the fundamental thesis of historical
materialism consists in explaining the ensemble of the
historical processes which are produced in a society,
beginning with its economic infrastructure and, therefore,
beginning with a composite economic structure in which
different sets of relations of production are combined. This thesis
does not imply that Marxism denies the importance of the
other levels of society. The economic structure determines,
in the last instance, social development; but it does not
automatically produce anything.
The ideological and juridico-political
levels have a relative autonomy, within the margins
which the economic structure allows them, that is, within
their own laws of development. Their development can be
more advanced, or it can lag behind with respect to the
economic structure.

The study of a social formation is fundamentally an
empirical study. It requires concrete data, statistics or other
such data, which must be subjected to critical study. The
other structures of the society can *never* be *deduced* from the
economic infrastructure. The economic level serves only as a
"guiding thread" in the detailed and specific investigation of the
ideological and juridical-political structures.

Finally, at the level of the social formation, the
historically given, social totality takes the form of a
"concrete individuality," which maintains a certain identity
through all its transformations. One country or a group of
countries is distinguished from another country or group of
countries by its individual characteristics and its history.
Different phases of development can be distinguished in this
history; that which determines the passage from one phase
to another is a change in the way in which the varied relations
of production which co-exist within it fit together. The
relations of production which occupy the dominant place in
the economic structure determine the character of the phase,
and, moreover, they lend it its name. When we speak of
capitalist countries, or semi-feudal countries, we are
referring to the dominant relations of production in the
social formation; but this does not preclude the existence of
other relations of production which occupy a subordinate
place.

If one were to use rigorous terminology, one would really have
to say: a capitalist-dominated social formation and a semifeudal-dominated
social formation.

## What is the Object of *Capital*?
With these two concept  -- *mode of production* and *social
formation* -- we can answer this question concerning the
object of *Capital*. We can formulate the question more
precisely as follows: is the object of *Capital* the study of the
capitalist mode of production (an abstract object) in its
entirety, or is it only the study of the economic structure of
this mode of production; or is it the study of a social
formation, that is, a historically given social reality:
England in the second half of the 19th century?

Let's see what Lenin had to see about this:
"The only object of Capital is the precise study of capitalist society.
This study implies a materialist analysis of that society and
of its superstructures."[^8.6]

And in a note a few pages further on, he adds that if other
features of the economic system of the middle ages have
been left out, it is because they belong to feudalism, whereas
Marx only was studying the capitalist system of
production.[^8.7]

In these texts, Lenin points out precisely the limits of
Marx's study: it deals with the regime, system, and social
organization of capitalism, that is, a pure, abstract object.
We ought to mention here that Lenin uses the term "social
formation" in the sense of mode of production.[^8.8]

The following text makes the abstract character of Marx's
object clearer:

> we are only
  out to present the internal organization of the capitalist mode of
  production, its ideal average, as it were.[^8.9.a]

[^8.9.a]: *Capital*, Vol. III, p. 970.

> The theory of capital assumes that the worker receives the
  full value of his labor power. This is the ideal of
  capitalism, but by no means it reality. The theory of rent
  presupposes that the entire agrarian population has been
  completely divided into landowners, capitalists and
  hired laborers. This is the ideal of capitalism, but by no
  means its reality. The theory of realization presupposes
  the proportional distribution of production. This is the
  ideal of capitalism, but by no means its reality.[^8.9.b]

[8.9.b]: Lenin, ["Once More on the Theory of Realization"](http://www.marx2mao.com/Lenin/TR99.html), *Collected Works*. Vol. 4, pp. 86-87.

Now let's see what Marx himself says about the
capitalist mode of production and about England:
"What I have to examine in this work is the capitalist mode of
production, and the relations of production and forms of inter-
course [*Verkehrsverhiiltnisse*] that correspond to it. Until now,
their *locus classicus* has been England. This is the reason why
England is used as the main illustration of the theoretical developments I make."[^8.9.c]

[^8.9.c]: *Capital*, Vol. I, Preface to the First Edition.

Therefore, in *Capital*, Marx studied an abstract object: *the
capitalist mode of production*. England in the second half of
the nineteenth century figures in this work only as an
example which serves to illustrate his theoretical statements,
since it was the country in which capitalism was most advanced.

But can we say that *Capital* is a study of the entirety of the
capitalist mode of production?

Before answering this question, let's see what Lenin says,
after having schematically analyzed the characteristics of
the economic structure of the capitalist system of
production:

> Such is the skeleton of Capital. The whole point, however, is that Marx did not content himself with this skeleton, that he did not confine himself to “economic theory” in the ordinary sense of the term, that, while explaining the structure and development of the given formation of society exclusively through production relations, he nevertheless everywhere and incessantly scrutinised the superstructure corresponding to these production relations and clothed the skeleton in flesh and blood. The reason Capital has enjoyed such tremendous success is that this book by a “German economist” showed the whole capitalist social formation to the reader as a living thing—with its everyday aspects, with the actual social manifestation of the class antagonism inherent in production relations, with the bourgeois political superstructure that protects the rule of the capitalist class, with the bourgeois ideas of liberty, equality and so forth, with the bourgeois family relationships.[^8.10]

[^8.10]: Lenin, [*What the “Friends of the People” Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1894/friends/index.htm). 

In this text, Lenin affirms that in *Capital* Marx does not
limit himself to studying the economic structure of the
capitalist mode of production but he also refers to the
corresponding superstructural elements.

What's really going on is that *Capital*, as we know it, is an
unfinished work. It represents the scientific study of
the "economic level" of the capitalist mode of production, and for
that reason it's generally considered a work of economics.
Marx also intended to analyze the law, State, and ideology of
the capitalist mode of production -- as he lets us see in the
in the work plan he presents in the *Introduction to a Critique of Political Economy* --
but, he didn't manage to get it done.
However, it is necessary to point out that this theory of the
"economic level" of the capitalist mode of production necessarily
presupposes, if not a developed theory, at least certain
theoretical elements that refer to the other parts of this 
mode of production: the ideological and juridico-political.
Lenin refers to these elements in the text cited above.

Therefore, *Capital* is not limited only to economics. It
goes far beyond the economy, fitting with the Marxist conception of
economic reality, which can only be understood as a level, a part,
a regional structure organically inscribed within the totality of
a mode of production. 
It is for this reason, in spite of the fact that Marx's analysis
remains fundamentally at the level of the capitalist economy,
that important theoretical elements can be found in his work
for elaborating the theory of the other levels of this mode of
production, elements which to this day have not been elaborated.[^8.11]

[^8.11]: Althusser, "Theory, Theoretical Practice...", p. 8.

Finally, it is necessary to point out that *Capital* is limited
to the complete and scientific study of the economic level of
the capitalist mode of production in its competitive phase,
which is fundamentally characterized by the free
competition of individual capitalists.

Despite the fact that
Marx discovered the tendency of the concentration of
capital and the formation of monopolies, he could not carry
on a scientific analysis of this stage in the development of
capitalism, since, as a thinker, he was limited in his
deliberations by the problematic of his own epoch.

## The Concept of Political Conjuncture

At this point we have seen the concepts of *mode of
production* and *social formation*. The former refers to an
abstract social totality, the latter to a historically
given social totality. Now we are going to study the
concept which refers to the most concrete level of analysis of
a social formation, the concept of *political conjuncture*.

The ***political conjuncture*** is the "current moment" of the
class struggle in a social formation or a system of social
formations.[^8.conjuncture]

[^8.conjuncture]: The concept of "political conjuncture" can refer both to a given social formation and to the global situation which frames relations between systems of social formations. For example, the global conjuncture which produced the victory of the socialist revolution in Russia, etc.

The political conjuncture is the "current moment" of a
social formation. This "current moment" is characterized by
a synthesis of the contradictions of a formation (or of a
system of social formations) in a given moment in its
development. It is expressed fundamentally as an
opposition between different social forces.

The great contribution of Mao Zedong to the study of
the conjuncture has been to provide us with a scientific
method for analyzing it in his claim that every political
conjuncture is a system of contradictions.

In this system, one contradiction occupies the principal
position and the others a secondary position.

There are many contradictions in the process of
development of a complex thing. Among them, one is
necessarily the principal contradiction: the one whose existence
and development determines or influences the existence
and development of the others.

>  For instance, in capitalist society the two forces in contradiction, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, form the principal contradiction. The other contradictions, such as those between the remnant feudal class and the bourgeoisie, between the peasant petty bourgeoisie ant the bourgeoisie, between the proletariat and the peasant petty bourgeoisie, between the non-monopoly capitalists and the monopoly capitalists, between bourgeois democracy and bourgeois fascism, among the capitalist countries and between imperialism and the colonies, are all determined or influenced by this principal contradiction. [^8.mao]

[^8.mao]: Mao Zedong, [*On Contradiction*](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm)

Moreover, each of these contradictions has two aspects: a
principal aspect and a secondary aspect.

> But, in any given contradiction, whether principal or secondary, should the two contradictory aspects be treated as equal? Again, no. In any contradiction the development of the contradictory aspects is uneven. Sometimes they seem to be in equilibrium, which is however only temporary and relative, while unevenness is basic. Of the two contradictory aspects, one must be principal and the other secondary. The principal aspect is the one playing the leading role in the contradiction. The nature of a thing is determined mainly by the principal aspect of a contradiction, the aspect which has gained the dominant position.
>
> But this situation is not static; the principal and the non-principal aspects of a contradiction transform themselves into each other and the nature of the thing changes accordingly.[^8.mao2]

[^8.mao2]: Ibid.

After studying the principal and secondary
contradictions, and their principal and secondary aspects, it
is important to study the particularities of each aspect.
For example, in the case of the proletariat we would
study the level of political consciousness of the militant,
revolutionary worker, the level of consciousness of the
working masses, the existence or non-existence of a labor
aristocracy, the degree of belief in the system of"democratic
government," etc.

Finally, it is not enough to know the particular
characteristics of each aspect; it is important to analyze what
kind of relation is established between the two aspects. "We
know, for instance, that the exploitative forces, which
always have more 'experience' than the exploited forces, use
two general forms of struggle: violence and deceit, bullets
and 'sugar coated bullets', the gun and the pen."[^8.12] Their
political domination permits them to use the repressive
force of the state against the exploited; their ideological
domination gives them the means of information and
propaganda to perpetrate collective deception. In a given
moment, the bourgeoisie primarily relies on deceit, in other
moments it resorts to violence, depending on the degree of
organization, consciousness, and combativeness of the
masses.

Concrete analysis involves the study of the specific form
of the struggle taking place between the two aspects of one
contradiction.

Any change in the system of contradictions which
defines a given conjuncture, be it at the level of the principal
and secondary contradictions, or at the level of the principal
and secondary aspects of these contradictions, produces
a corresponding change in the current moment: a
change in the political conjuncture.

Only a correct analysis of the political conjuncture -- that
is, of the current moment -- lets us put forward adequate
slogans of struggle, that is, slogans which can advance the
revolutionary forces.

In Russia, there was a fundamental difference between
the contradictions resolved by the February Revolution
and the contradictions resolved by the October
Revolution, as well as between the methods used to
resolve them. The principle of using different methods to
resolve different contradictions is one which Marxist-Leninists
must strictly observe. The dogmatists do not
observe this principle. They ignore the differences between
distinct revolutionary situations, and therefore do not
understand that one has to use different methods to resolve
different contradictions. They instead uniformly adopt a
formula which they imagine to be inalterable, and mechanically
apply it everywhere. This practice only leads to setbacks
for the revolution.[^8.13]

[^8.13]: Mao Zedong, op. cit. In Lenin's writings from
  the period between the February Revolution and the October Revolution, we find excellent analyses of the distinct conjunctures which were arising and of the new political slogans which had to be put forward in each situation.

## The Concept of Transition[^8.14]

[^8.14]: We want to warn the reader that this section is one of the weakest in the book.

In studying the concept of mode of production, we saw that
it refers to a dynamic structure which continuously tends to
reproduce its conditions of existence. In this part we'll
study the conditions which determine the change from one
mode of production to another.

According to traditional Marxist
thought, 
the material basis of the transition from one mode of
production to another 
is characterized by a mismatch between
the old dominant relations of production which come into
contradiction with the degree of development reached by the
productive forces. It is a matter of replacing the old
relations of production by new ones which correspond to the
level reached by the development of the productive forces.

The growth of the productive forces and the embryonic
rise of new relation of production have a spontaneous and
unforeseen character. The agents of production, by
perfecting the old means of production and creating new
ones, thereby developing the productive forces, do not
realize the social consequences which they produce. Their
thinking, their consciousness, does not go beyond the
immediate benefit that this process gives them.

But the development of the productive forces and the
change produced in the relations of production operate
spontaneously only up to a certain limit. When the new
productive forces and the social relations of production
which correspond to them, which have been born within the
old infrastructure, come into conflict with the old social
relations of production which had dominated them,
spontaneous development is replaced by conscious activity.
This is the struggle of the most advanced classes, that is,
those which arise from the new relations of production by creating
at the economic, juridico-political and ideological levels
conditions which favor the development of the new relations
of production.

Now then, the old relations of production are defended by the
old ruling classes which have at their disposal the state and
all the means of ideological influence over the masses. They
are interested in maintaining the old relations of production, and
they use whatever methods they have at their disposal to resist the
advanced social forces which aspire to put an end to the old
forms of property in order to open the way for the full
development of the productive forces.

Only through the class struggle -- through revolution -- is
it possible to destroy the power of the old ruling classes
and the economic consequences of that power.

The revolutionary classes create new power,
revolutionary power, and by relying on it they destroy the
obstacles which prevent the full development of the
productive forces and the new relations of production
corresponding to them. In this way the spontaneous process
of social development first laid at the level of the
infrastructure, is replaced by the conscious activity of the
masses guided by the class most interested in breaking with
the old system.

The economic basis and cause of social revolutions was
explained by Marx in his *Preface to a Critique of Political
Economy*:

> At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. *Then begins an era of social revolution.* (Our emphasis, M.H.)

Now, using the concepts of *modes of production* and of
*social formation*, we can say that this "transition from one
mode of production to another" always takes place within a
given social formation. 

What happens first is this: within the composite economic
structure of the aforementioned social formation, in which coexist
various modes of production of material goods (that is,
different sets of relations of production), one of the sets of
relations of production which had up to this point been subordinate,
begins to acquire a more and more important role.
This continues until it becomes the dominant set of relations of production
at the level of the economic structure.
Now, since the jurdico-political and idelogical structures of
the social formation haven't changed -- tending to favor the
old dominant relations of production -- it becomes necessary
that the class representing the new relations of production
take over the state apparatus in order to change the ideological
and juridico-political conditions which are curbing the development
of the new relations of production.

The conscious and violent process of destroying the
old relations of production, that is the *revolution*, is the
general law which characterizes the change of dominance of
one social relation of production to another in a given social
formation.

What is particular to the transition from capitalism to
socialism is that *it is not possible for socialist relations
of production to arise* in the middle of capitalist society -- that is, a social formation in which
capitalist relations of production predominate -- as
has been the case in all previous societies in which the new relations
of production were born within the social formation in which other
relations of production predominated.

For example, in France, the transition (in terms of the economic structure)
from the feudal mode of production dominant until that time, to the capitalist
mode of production, 
essentially took place before the Revolution of 1789. That
is, not only the productive forces but also capitalist social
relations of production already existed. From this point, the
Revolution of 1789, a revolution at the juridico-political
level, took place after the (spontaneous) revolution on the
economic level. The taking of power by the bourgeoisie only
served to consolidate and stimulate the productive forces
and their corresponding relations of production.

On the other hand, if in the very heart of a social
formation dominated by capitalism productive forces are
born and developed of a more and more social
character that could serve as the basis of socialist relations of
production, these relations cannot be established without a
revolution which would give political power to the working
class.

Establishing social relations of production does not
simply involve transforming the factories in such a way that
capital is suppressed and that the workers administer the
enterprise. If the problem could be reduced to this, the seeds of
socialism could arise within a capitalist society, like the case
of the kibbutzes in Israel. But since socialist relations of
production do not refer to only the factories but to the entire
economy of the country -- the ways in which different sectors
of production must be coordinated, etc. -- they cannot be
born within capitalist society, whose law of development
implies precisely a certain anarchy of social production.

Till now we have seen that historical materialism shows us
that to
a certain degree of development of productive forces
correspond certain social relations of production, and how
on the base of these relations certain jurdico-political
and ideological relations are established.
If the relations of production change, then sooner or later the
other relations change too.

But this thesis of historical materialism, which seems to
establish a certain order -- step one, changes in the
infrastructure, step two, change in the superstructure -- must
be critically studied.

Which modes of production is Marx referring to when he
asserts this in the Preface to the Critique?

He is referring to the modes of production in which
"bourgeois society" is the "last antagonistic form". He
says that with this bourgeois society -- or capitalist mode of
production -- "the prehistory of human society accordingly closes."

Therefore, if until the establishment of the capitalist mode
of production it is possible to say, in general, that the
juridico-political and ideological relations only arise to
confirm and support the relations of production which have
arisen spontaneously from the infrastructure, this statement
is no longer valid for the transition from capitalism to
socialism.

The transition from capitalist relations of production to
socialist relations of production does not happen
spontaneously.

In the transition from capitalism to socialism, the juidico-political
relations are the first to be established. The taking
of political power by the working class (or by the working
class and its allies) creates the conditions which permit the
establishment of socialist relations of production and
new ideological relations which permit the full development
of the productive forces. This full development is the necessary basis for the final
establishment of communism: "to each according to their
needs."

Let's see now how Engels describes this process:

> With the seizing of the means of production by society production of commodities is done away with, and, simultaneously, the mastery of the product over the producer. Anarchy in social production is replaced by systematic, definite organisation. The struggle for individual existence disappears. Then for the first time man, in a certain sense, is finally marked off from the rest of the animal kingdom, and emerges from mere animal conditions of existence into really human ones. The whole sphere of the conditions of life which environ man, and which have hitherto ruled man, now comes under the dominion and control of man who for the first time becomes the real, conscious lord of nature because he has now become master of his own social organisation. The laws of his own social action, hitherto standing face to face with man as laws of nature foreign to, and dominating him, will then be used with full understanding, and so mastered by him. Man’s own social organisation, hitherto confronting him as a necessity imposed by nature and history, now becomes the result of his own free action. The extraneous objective forces that have hitherto governed history pass under the control of man himself. Only from that time will man himself, with full consciousness, make his own history — only from that time will the social causes set in movement by him have, in the main and in a constantly growing measure, the results intended by him. It is the humanity's leap from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom. [^8.engels]

[^8.engels]: Engels, [*Anti-Duhring*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch24.htm), Part 3, Chapter 2.

The transition from capitalism to socialism is, therefore, a
transition in which revolutionary political action leads
the relations of production.
The "spontaneist" deviation of
Marxism does not see the radical difference between the
transition from capitalism to socialism and the other
previous transitions. It applies the same model to all
transitions and remains waiting for the capitalist social
formation to evolve spontaneously towards socialism.

## Summary

In this chapter we have studied the concepts of mode of
production, social formation, and political conjuncture. We
have seen that the first refers to an abstract social totality,
the second to a concrete, historically given social
totality, and the third to the "current moment" of a social
formation.

Using the concepts of mode of production and of social
formation we have been able to show what is the object of
Marx's *Capital*. Finally, we have looked at the concept of
transition from one mode of production to another.
Therefore, in this chapter we have defined the following
concepts of the general theory of historical materialism:

- mode of production
- social formation
- political conjuncture.

### Questions
1. What are the two senses in which the concept mode of
  production is used?
2. What does mode of production mean?
3. Why is it important to be able to have a theoretical
  concept in order to analyze reality?
4. Why does the concept of mode of production refer to an
  abstract totality?
5. What does social formation mean?
6. Why can we not use country as a synonym for social
  formation?
7. What is the object of *Capital*?
8. Can we say that *Capital* is out of date?
9. What is a political conjuncture?
10. What is the scientific method to study a political
  conjuncture?
11. Why is it important to study a political conjuncture?
12. What is meant by transition?
13. What differentiates the transitions prior to
  capitalism from the transition from capitalism to socialism?

### Themes for reflection

1. Is it possible to speak of a social formation dominated
  by capitalism if, at the level of the economic structure, it is
  not capitalist relations of production that dominate?
2. How does one determine when a mode of production
  of material goods and its corresponding relations of
  production come to occupy the dominant role in the
  economic structure of a social formation?
3. Why is it important to carefully limit the object of
  *Capital*?
4. Could you make an analysis of the current conjuncture
  of your country by applying the method of the system of
  contradictions?


[^8.1]: Here Marx is referring to pre-capitalist relations in which the
landlord is the owner of the land and the direct producer is only a
possessor. De jure all his surplus labor belongs to the landlord.

[^8.2]: The concept of a structure in dominance used here was introduced
  by Louis Althusser in his article, "On the Materialist Dialectic," in
  *For Marx*. In the introduction to the Spanish edition (*La revolución teórica de Marx*) we gave the following definition of
  this concept: "the structure in dominance defines the Marxist
  totality as a complex whole which possesses the unity of a
  coordinated structure, in which there is one element which plays the
  dominant role and others which are subordinated to it; a dynamic
  unity in which there is an exchange of roles, the economic level
  being what determines in the last instance the element of the social
  structure which will play the dominant role."

[^8.3]: We think that it is not correct to state, as Poulantzas does in his
  book, *Poder político y clases sociales en el Estado capitalista* ("Political Power and Social Classes"),
  that the matrix of the
  mode of production is the type of coordination of its different levels.
  If, as Poulantzas himself points out (p. 22), it is the relations of
  production (property, real appropriation) which determine the
  type of coordination of the levels of the mode of production, this
  type of coordination is only an effect of that which really sets up
  the matrix of this mode: the relations of production. We think this
  conception of Poulantzas is the strategic nodal point of his
  theoretical errors about the concept of social classes.

[^8.4]: It seems to us that the serious error which Andre Gunder Frank
  makes in his first books and articles on Latin America is to believe
  that in order to assert the domination of the world capitalist system
  it is necessary to deny the existence of any type of pre-capitalist
  relations. The domination of capitalism in relations of exchange is
  confused with the domination at the level of relations of
  production. This error prevents the correct analysis of social classes
  in Latin America.

[^8.5]: The definition of a social formation as a simple combination of
modes of production is given by Poulantzas in his book, 
*Poder político y clases sociales en el Estado capitalista* ("Political
Power and Social Classes in the Capitalist State"), pp. 13-14.

[^8.6]: Lenin, [*What the “Friends of the People” Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1894/friends/index.htm). 

[^8.7]: Ibid.

[^8.8]: Lenin uses the term "social formation" in an undifferentiated
  sense both to refer to an abstract social totality (what we have
  called "mode of production") and to refer to a concrete social
  totality (what we have called "social formation"). Therefore, it is
  necessary to determine in what sense Lenin uses the term, whenever it appears in one of his texts.
