1. The Concept of Mode of Production
Now that we have studied the economic, juridicopolitical,
and ideological levels of society, we can move on to
those elements which will permit us to define the Marxist
concept of mode of production.
Marx and Engels frequently used the expression "mode of
production of material goods" or simply "mode of
production" in order to describe the manner, the form, the
mode by which material goods are produced.
Let us look at some texts:
The mode of production of material life conditions the
general process of social, political, and intellectual life.
[Preface to a Conlribution to the Critique of Political
Economy]
It is not the articles made, but how they are made, and by
what instruments, that enables us to distinguish different
economic epochs. [Capital]
At first, capital subordinates labor on the basis of the
technical conditions in which it historically finds it. It
does not, therefore, change immediately the mode of
production. The production of surplus value-in the
form hitherto considered by us by means of simple
extension of the working-day proved, therefore, to be
independent of any change in the mode of production
itself. [ Capital]
The materialist conception of history starts from the
principle that production, and with production the
exchange of its products, is the basis of every social order:
that in every society which \las appeared in history the
distribution of the products, and with it the division of
society into classes or estates, is determined by what is
produced and how it is produced, and how the product is
exchanged. According to this conception, the ultimate
causes of all social changes and political revolutions are
to be sought, not in the minds of men, in their increasing
insight into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the
mode of production and exchange; they are to be sought
not in the philosophy but in the economics of the epoch
concerned. [Engels, Anti-Duhring]
We should not confuse the expression "mode of
production of material goods" with the concept mode of
production. The former is a descriptive notion which only
refers to the economic structure of society; the latter, on the
contrary, is a theoretical concept which refers to the entire
social totality, that is, both to the economic structure as well
as to the other levels of the social totality: juridico-political
and ideological.
Marx and Engels never defined the concept of mode of
production which they so often use. The majority of Marxist
writers use this term without defining it; and those who do
define it, limit its significance to the economic level alone.
We think, nevertheless, in accord with Louis Althusser, that
the reduction of this concept to only the economic level
limits the implicit sense which Marx gave it in his most
finished work, Capital. â€¢
By studying the mode of production of material goods,
that is, what we have called the production process, we have
seen that, from the Marxist point of view, it is not enough to
define it only as a technical process. This technical process
takes place under determined social relations, the social
relations of production, which, in the last instance, make the
process possible. Moreover, we have seen that elements of
the superstructure of society enter into the making of these
relations. Without the explicit, or implicit consent of the
members of society and its institutions, these relations could
not remain in force.

Engels affirms this concerning class societies, m the
following text:
Former society, moving in class antagonisms, had need
of the state, that is, an organization of the exploiting class
at each period for the maintenance of its external
conditions of production; that is, therefore, for the
forcible holding down of the exploited class in the
conditions of oppression (slavery, villenage or serfdom,
wage labor) determined by the existing mode of
production. [Anti-Duhring]
In this text Engels shows the necessity for the existence of
superstructural conditions to maintain a determined kind of
social production.
Let us see now, what Marx says in one of the few explicit
passages in Capital on this question:
However, it is evident that tradition must play a
dominant role in the primitive and underdeveloped
circumstances on which these social production
relations 1 and the corresponding mode of production are
based. It is furthermore clear that here, as always, it is in
the interest of the ruling section of society to sanction the
existing order as law and to legally establish its limits
given through usage and tradition. Apart from all else,
this, by the way, comes about by itself as soon as the
constant reproduction of the basis of the existing order
and its fundamental relations assumes a regulated and
orderly form in the course of time. And such regulation
and order are themselves indispensable elements of any
mode of production, if it is to assume social stability and
independence from mere changes and arbitrariness.
These are precisely the form of its social stability and
therefore its relative freedom from mere arbitrariness and
mere change. Under backward conditions of the
production process, as well as the corresponding social
relations, it achieves this form by mere repetition of their
very reproduction. [Capital V. III.]
If tradition and order are "indispensable elements of any
mode of production," as Marx clearly says in this text, this
cannot be defined only as the economic structure of society,
but includes the entire social totality.
The concept of mode of production is precisely the
concept which gives us a scientific way to think about a
social totality.
There is a great difference between describing-pointing
out its visible characteristics-and knowing something.
When a patient tells his doctor what he feels, he only is
describing the symptoms of his illness. The doctor, with his
knowledge of the human organism, is able to diagnose a
given illness starting from these symptoms, for example,
appendicitis. He sums up in one word the extensive
description of the symptoms which the patient makes. This
word implies a knowledge of the illness. The application of
the knowledge is what enables him to cure the patient. In
order to properly diagnose a given illness, it is necessary to
grasp the unity which enables one to understand the
different symptoms. Likewise, in order to define an objectto
understand it-it is necessary to discover the unity, or the
form of organization of the elements which first served to
describe it.
It is possible to describe a society; to say for example, that
in every society there are industries, cultivated land, post
offices, schools, an army, police, laws, ideological currents,
etc. But the organization of these elements in different
24
structures ( economic, juridico-political, and ideological)
and the determination of the role which each one of these
structures plays in the society,_permits us to pass from the
description to the understanding of a social reality, to
establish its laws of development and, therefore, the
possibility of consciously guiding it. In Marx's time
everyone perceived and described the symptoms of
"capitalist illness": the poverty of the masses, the wealth of
certain small groups, the exploitation of women and
children, etc. Some rebelled; others sought to explain this
situation by returning to fatalistic, divine laws: "there have
always been poor people and there always will be." But
Marx and Engels knew how to advance from the description
to knowledge of the causes and the laws of capitalist
development, knowledge which later permitted Marxist
parties to make revolution and establish new social systems.
From what has been said above, it is possible to better
understand the statement we have made: the concept of
mode of production is the theoretical concept which lets us
think the social totality.
Every mode of production is constituted by: ( 1) a global
structure formed by three regional structures: the economic
structure, the juridico-political structure (laws, the state,
etc.), the ideological structure (ideas, customs, etc.); (2) In
this global structure, one of the regional structures
dominates the others.
It is important to point out here that it is not always the
economic level or structure which plays the dominant role,
as those who vulgarize Marxism frequently claim. Marx
clearly tells us this in a footnote in the first volume of
Capital:
I seize this opportunity of shortly answering an objection
taken by a German paper in America, to my work, "Zur
Kritik der Politicen Oekonomie, 1859." In the estimation
of that paper, my view that each special mode of
production and the social relations corresponding to it, in
short, that the economic structure of society, is the real
basis on which the juridical and political superstructure is
raised, and to which definite social forms of thought
correspond; that the mode of production determines the
character of the social, political, and intellectual life
generally, all this is very true for our own times, which
material interests preponderate, but not for the middle
ages, in which Catholicism, nor for Athens and Rome,
where politics, reigned supreme. In the first place it
strikes one as an odd thing for anyone to suppose that
these well-worn phrases about the middle ages and the
ancient world are unknown to anyone else. This much,
however, is clear that the middle ages could not live on
Catholicism, nor the ancient world on politics. On the
contrary, it is the mode in which they gained a livelihood
that explains why here politics, and there Catholicism
played the chief part. [ Capital]
If we sum up the essentials of the note, we can see that
Marx held that if economics dominates in capitalism, we
cannot deny that in the middle ages Catholicism dominated
(that is to say, an ideological structure) and in Athens and
Rome it was politics which was dominant. But he says: "it is
the mode in which they gained a livelihood that explains"
why here politics and there Catholicism played the chief ( or
dominant) role.
(3) In this global structure, the economic structure is
always determinant in the last instance.

As the text we have just cited indicates, it is the economic
conditions which dererm.ine which of the regional structures
will have the dominant role.
The distinction between the dominant and determinant
role in the last instance is a fundamental distinction which
must be made, and to which Althusser has given full weight.
It is difficult to find explicit formulations about this
distinction in Marx and Engels since the object of their study
was the capitalist mode of production in which both
determinants coincide. In this mode of production
economics plays not only the determinant role in the last
instance, but also the dominant role.
Let us define more precisely what we mean by a dominant
tructure. At the level of the mode of production we
consider that regional structure dominant which plays the
fundamental role in the reproduction of a given mode of
production.
In the case of the capitalist mode of production, its
reproduction is assured by laws internal to the economic
structure. This does not mean that superstructural elements
are absent, but that their presence is not the fundamental
element in the reproduction of the system. The laws of
capitali t economic development (accumulation, extended
reproducton, e.tc.) determine that form in which the system
reproduces itself and give it its specific character. The
superstructural factors, only intervene manifestly when
obstacles arise which block the unfolding of these laws. This
knowledge permits us to affirm that in the capitalist mode of
production it is the economic structure which occupies the
dominant place within the global structure of the mode of
production.
In the case of the feudal mode of production, it is not the
economic laws which assure the reproduction of the sy tern.
In order that the surplus continue to be appropriated by the
landlords, the active and fundamental intervention of
uperstructural elements is required. Without a
fundamental relation hip of dependence linked to
ideological andjuridico-political factor , the serfs would not
work the land of the lord, nor would they turn over a part of
their labor in other forms of rent (in kind or .in money). In
thi mode of production therefore, it is the ideological or
juridico-political uper tructure which is dominant, since it
is through them that the reproduction of the mode of
production is assured.
(4) Finally, what characterizes every mode of production
is its dynamism, that is, the continuous reproduction of its
conditions of existence. The capitalist mode of production,
for example, at the ame time that it reproduces material
goods in a form which requires the division of labor in that
social totality into capitalists and workers, and which
creates an entire ideology that favors this kind of production
and a form of power that defend and stimulates it, also
continuously reproduces its conditions of reproduction.
At the same time that it produces material goods, it
reproduces capitalist relations of production. And at the
same time that it reproduces these relations, it reproduces its
super tructural condition of existence; that is, the
ideological conditions and the power relations, as well as the
role that they play within the social structure.
MODE OF PRODUCTION is the theoretical concept which
permits us to think the social totality as a structure in
dominance,2 in which the economic level is determinant in
the last instance.
To conclude, we must insist that the structural nucleus or
matrix of the mode of production is the relations of
production. These relations explain the characteristic type
of articulation of the different regional structures in each
mode of production; they determine which of the structures
will occupy the dominant role. Let us recall that Marx
explicitly says that 'the direct relationship of the owners of
the conditions of production to the direct producers" reveals
to us "the innermost secret, the hidden basis of the entire
social structure." [ Capital]3
2. The Concept of Social Formation
The concept of mode of production refers to an abstract
object, a pure social totality, an "ideal" in which the
production of material goods is carried out in a
homogeneous form. But in the great majority of historically
determined societie , the production of material goods is not
affected in a homogeneous way. In the same society it is
possible to find different kinds of relations of production.
Russia as anaJyzed by Lenin in hfa article on "The Tax in
Kind" (which corresponds more or less, to tbe period
between J 9 I 7 and 1929) is an example of the combination of
different economic ystems. Let is see how Lenin
enumerated them: (I) patriarchal peasant economy; that is
to say, to a great degree, a natural economyÂ· (2) small
commodity production (this category includes the majority
of the peasants who sell wheat); (3) private capitali mÂ· (4)
state capitalismÂ· (5) socialism.
Russia was so large and varied that all these different
economic and social forms were mixed in it. It is in this Â·that
the originality of the Russian situation was constituted.
Another example i France as analyzed by Marx in the
18th .Brumaire of Louis Napoleon. There we had the
combination of different mode of production of material
go~ds: feudal patriarchal small commodity, and
capitalist.
These diverse relations of production which co-exi tin a
historically determined society do not do so in an anarchic
way, nor are they isolated from one another- one of them
occupies a dominant place, imposing on the rest its own laws
of operation.
In the Introduction to the Critique of Political Economy
Marx s;iys the following: "In every form of society it i a
determinant production and the relations engendered by it
which assign to all other production and the relation
engendered by them their place and importance."
lf we study, for example, the diverse countries of Latin
America we find there diverse relations of production
which range from highly developed capitali t relation to
those which characterize on economy of near autarchy in
certain regions; with capitalist relation of production
dominating in the majority, if not in all of them. The
capitalist relations ubject to their law of development the
other relations which are subordinated to them.
Therefore, in the majority of the hi torically determined
societies we encounter various relations of production. But
in this diver ity there is always one relation of production
which is dominant and whose laws of operation have a
decisive influence over the rest.
From what has been said above we can deduce that the
domination of a given type of relations of production does
not automatically make all the other relations of production
disappear; these can continue to exist, although modified
and subordinated to the dominant relations of production.
We can point out, for example, that since the epoch of
their conquest, Latin American countries have been
subjected to the world capitalist system, at first under the
form of commercial capitalism and later through relations
of production distinctly capitalist (in the majority of
countries). But to say that this world capitalist system
dominates does not mean to deny that there were and still
are, in a very diffuse form, pre-capitalist relations of
production: relations of production which are close to those
of the primitive community in some isolated places, semifeudal
relations in many peasant zones, and a significantly
large diffusion of small, artisan production. 4
The dominant relations of production not only impose
their laws of operation on the other relations of production
that are subordinated to them, but they also determine the
general character of the superstructure of the society.
The complexity of the economic structure and the
dominant character of one of the relations of pr6duction
that co-exist in it, explains the complex character of the
. ideological and juridical-political structure of every
historically determined society.
To designate this historically determined social reality, we
use the concept of social formation. This concept refers, as
we have seen, to a concrete, complex, impure reality, like all
reality; to distinguish it from the concept of mode of
production which refers to an abstract, pure, "ideal" object.
SOCIAL FORMATION is a concrete, historically determined,
social reality.
This concrete, historically determined, social totality can
correspond to a given country, or to a series of countries
which have more or less similar characteristics and a
common history. Thus, we can speak of the Chilean,
Mexican, etc. social formation, as well as the Latin
American social formation.
As with every social totality, this concrete, historically
determined social totality is composed of an economic
structure, an ideological structure, and a juridico-political
structure; but at this level, they have a much more complex
character. Therefore, in every social formation, with very
few exceptions, we find (I) a complex economic structure, in
which diverse relations of production co-exist. One of these
relations occupies a dominant place, imposing its laws of
operation on the other, subordinated relations; (2) a
complex ideological structure formed by different
ideological tendencies. The dominant ideological tendency,
which subordinates and deforms the other tendencies,
generally corresponds to the ideological tendency of the
ruling class, that is, to the ideological tendency belonging to
the exploiting pole of the dominant relation of production;
(3) a complex juridico-political structure which fulfills the
function of domination by the ruling class.
The social formation is, therefore, a complex structure,
composed of complex regional structures which are
articulated starting from the structure of the relations of
26
production. It is necessary to study each regional structure
in its relative autonomy in relation to the rest and in
accordance with its own characteristics.
The concept of mode of production refers to an abstract
social totality ( capitalist, feudal, slave, etc.). The concept of
social formation refers to a concrete social totality. This is
not a combination of modes of production, of abstract or
ideal social totalities; it is a concrete, historically determined
reality, structured beginning with the form in which the
different relations of production which co-exist at the level
of the economic structure are combined. 5
Therefore, to study a social formation, to study a given
country, we must always begin by diagnosing what kind of
relations of production exist, how they are combined, what
is the dominant relation of production, and how it exercises
its influence over the subordinated relations of production.
We know that the fundamental thesis of historical
materialism consists in explaining the entirety of the
historical processes which are produced in a society,
beginning with its economic infrastructure and, therefore,
beginning with a complex economic ~tructure in which
different relations of production are combined. This thesis
does not mean that Marxism denies the importance of the
other leve1s of society. The economic structure determines,
in the last instance, social development; but it produces
nothing automatically. The ideological and juridicopolitical
levels have a relative autonomy, within the margins
which the economic structure allows them, that is, within
their own laws of development. Their development can be
more advanced, or it can lag behind with respect to the
economic structure.
The study of a social formation is fundamentally an
empirical study. It requires concrete data, statistics or other
such data, which must be subjected to critical study. The
other structures of the society can never be deduced from the
economic infrastructure. Economics serves only as a
"guideline" in the detailed and specific investigation of the
ideological and juridical-political structures.
Finally, at the level of the social formation, the
historically determined, social totality takes the form of a
"concrete individuality," which maintains a certain identity
through all its transformations. One country or a group of
countries is distinguished from another country or group of
countries by its individual characteristics and its history.
Different phases of development can be distinguished in this
history; that which determines the passage from one phase
to another is a change in the way in which different relations
of production which co-exist within it are interrelated. The
relations of production which occupy the dominant place in
the economic structure determine the character of the phase,
and, moreover, they lend it its name. When we speak of
capitalist countries, or semi-feudal countries, we are
referring to the dominant relations of production in the
social formation; but this does not preclude the existence of
other relations of production which occupy a subordinate
place.
If we were to apply rigorous terminology, we would have
to say: a capitalist dominated social formation and a semifeudal
dominated social formation.

3. What is the Object of Capital?
With these two concept -mode of prduction and social
formation-we can answer this question concerning the
object of Capital. We can formulate the question more
precisely as follows: is the object of Capital the study of the
capitalist mode of production (an abstract object) in its
entiretyÂ· or is it only the study of the economic structure of
thi mode of production; or is it the study of a social
formation, that i . an historically determined social reality:
England in the second haJf of the 19th century?
Let us look at what Lenin says in this respect: "The only
object of Capital is the precise study of capitalist society.
This study implies a materialist analysis of that society and
of its superstructures." 6
And in a note a few pages further on, he adds that if other
features of the economic sy tern of the middle ages have
been left out, it is because they belong to feudalism, whereas
Marx only was tudying the capitalist system of
production.1
In these texts enin points out precisely the limits of
Marx's study: it deals with the regime, system, and social
organization of capitalism, that is, a pure, abstract object.
We ought to mention here that Lenin uses the term "social
formation" in the sense of mode of production. 8
The following text makes the abstract character of Marx's
object clearer:
Our mis ion, writes Marx is to explain simply the
internal organi:tation of the capitalist system of
production in its ideal form, in a manner of speaking.
[Capital]
The theory of capital assumes that the worker receives the
full value of his labor power. This is the ideal of
capitalism, but by no means it reality. The theory of rent
presupposes that the entire agrarian population has been
completely divided into landowners, capitaHsts and
hired laborers. This is the ideal of capitalism, but by no
means its reality. The theory of realization presupposes
the proportional distribution of production. This is the
ideal of capitalism, but by. no means its reality.9
Now let us look at what Marx himself says about the
capitalist mode of production and about England:
In this work I have to examine the capitalist mode of
production, and the conditions of production and
exchange corresponding to that mode. Up to the present
time, their classic ground is England. That is the reason
why England is used as the chief illustration in the
development of my theoretical ideas. [Capital]
Therefore, in Capital Marx studied an abstract object: the
capi1alist mode of production. England in the second half of
the nineteenth century figures in this work only as an
example which serves to illustrate his theoretical statements,
since it is the country where capitalism was most advanced.
But can we say that Capital is a study of the entire
capitalist mode of production?
Before answering this question, let us see what Lenin says,
after having analyzed schematically the Â·characteristics of
the economic structure of the capitalist system of
production:
Such is the skeleton of Capital. The whole point,
however, is that Marx did not content himself with this
skeleton that he did not confine himself to 'economic
theory' in the ordinary sense of the term, that, while
explaining the structure and development of the given
formation of society exclusively through production
relations, he nevertheless everywhere and incessantly
scrutinized the superstructure correspnding to these
production relations and clothed the skeleton in flesh and
blood. The reason Capital has enjoyed such tremendous
success is that this book by a 'German economist' showed
the whole capitalist social formation to the reader as a
living thing-with its everyday aspects, with the actual
social manifestation of the class antagonism inherent in
production relations, with the bourgeois political
superstructure that protects the rule of the capitalist
class, with the bourgeois ideas of liberty, equality, and so
forth, with the bourgeois family relationships. 10
In this text Lenin affirms that in Capital Marx does not
limit himself to studying the economic structure of the
capitalist mode of production but he also refers to the
superstructures that correspond to it.
The fact of the matter is that Capital, as we know it, is an
unfinished work. It represents the scientific tudy of the
"economic level'' of the capitalist mode of production, and it
is for this reason that it is generally considered a work of
economics. Marx tried to analyze the laws the state and the
ideology of the capitalist mode of production as well, as we
can see from the work plan which he presents in an
Introduction to a Critique of Political Econo,n.y; but time
ran out before he could complete it. Nevertheless, it is
necessary to point out that this theory of the "economic
level" of the capitalist mode of production necessari.ly
assumes, if not a developed theory, at least certain
theoretical elements which refer to other instances of the
mode of production: ideological and juridico-political. It is
to these elements that Lenin refers in the text cited ?,bove.
Therefore, Capital is not limited only to economics. It
goes far beyond economics, in conformity with the Marxist
conception of economic reality, which holds that economics
can be understood only as a level, a part, a regional structure
organically inscribed in the totality of a mode of production.
It is for this reason, in spite of the fact that Marx's analyses
remain fundamentally at the level of the capitalist economy,
that important theoretical elements can be found in his work
for elaborating the theory of the other levels of this mode of
production, element which up to this moment are yet to be
elaborated .11
Finally, it is necessay to point out that Capital is limited
to the complete and scientific study of the economic level of
the capitalist mode of production in its competitive phase
which is fundamentally characterized by the free
competition ofindividual capitalists. In spite of the fact that
Marx di covered the tendency of the concentration of
capital and the formation of monopolies, he could not carry
on a scientific analysi of this stage in the development of
capitalism, since, as a thinker, he was limited in his
deliberations by the problematic of his own epoch.
4. The Concept of Political Conjuncture
At this point we have looked at the concepts of mode of
production and social formation. The former refers to an
abstract social totality, the latter to an historically
determined social totality. Now we are going to study the
concept which refers to the most concrete level of analysis of
a social formation, the concept of political conjuncture.
The POLITICAL CONJUNCTURE is the" current moment" of the
class struggle in a social formation or a system of social
f ormations. 12
The political conjuncture is the "current moment" of a
social formation. This "current moment" is characterized by
a synthesis of the contradictions of a formation or of a
system of social formations in a given moment in its
development. It is expres ed fundamentally as an
opposition between different social forces.
The great contribution of Mao Tse-tung to the study of
the conjuncture has been to provide us with a scientific
method for analyzing it by asserting that every political
conjuncture is a system of contradictions.
In this system one contradiction occupies the principal
place and the others a secondary place.
There are many contradictions in the process of
development of a complex thing, and one of them is
necessarily the principle contradiction whose existence
and development determine or influence the existence
and development of the other contradictions.
For instance, in capitalist society the two forces in
contradiction, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, form
the principal contradiction. The other co.ntradiction ,
such as those between the remnant feudal class and the
bourgeoisie, between the peasant petty bourgeoisie and
the bourgeoisie, between the proletariat and the pea ant
petty bourgeoisie, between the non-monopoly capitalists
and the monopoly capitalists, between bourgeois
democracy and bourgeois fascism, among the capitalist
countries and between imperialism and the colonies, are
all determined or influenced by this principal
contradiction. [Mao, On Contradiction]
Moreover, each of these contradictions has two aspects: a
principal aspect and a secondary aspect.
But, in any given contradiction, whether principal or
secondary, should the two contradictory aspects be
treated as equal? Again, no. In any contradiction the
development of the contradictory aspects is uneven.
Sometimes they seem to be in equilibrium, which is
however only temporary and relative, while unevenness is
basic. Of the two contradictory aspects, one must be
principal and the other secondary. The principal aspect i
the only one playing the leading role in the contradiction
The nature of a thing is determined mainly by the
principal aspect of a contradiction, the aspect which has
gained the dominant position.
But this situation is not static; the principal and the
non-principal aspects of a contradiction transform
themselves into each other and the nature of the thing
changes accordingly. [Mao, On Contradiction]
After having studied the principal and secondary
contradictions, and their principal and secondary aspects, it
is important to study the particularitie of each one of these
aspect.. or example, in lhe case of the proletariat we have
to study the level of political consciousness of the militant,
revolutionary worker the level of consciousnes of the
working masses, the existence or non-existence of a labor
aristocracy, the degree of belief in the system of"democratic
government," etc.
28
Finally, it is not enough to know the particular
characteristics of each aspect; it is important to analyze what
kind of relation is established between both aspects. "We
know, for instance, that the exploitative forces, which
always have more 'experience' than the exploited forces, use
two general forms of struggle: violence and fraud, bullets
and 'sugar coated bullets', the gun and the pen." Their
political domination permits them to utilize the repressive
force of the state against the exploited; the ideological
domination gives them the means of information and
propaganda to perpetrate collective fraud. In a given
moment, the bourgeoisie primarily relies on fraud, in other
moments it resorts to violence, depending on the degree of
organization, consciousness, and combativeness of the
masses.
Concrete analysis assumes the study of the specific form
of struggle which takes place between the two aspects of the
same contradiction.
Any modification in the system of contradictions which
defines a given conjuncture, be it at the level of the principal
and secondary contradictions, or at the level of the principal
and secondary aspects of these contradictions, produces, at
the same time, a modification in the current moment, a
change in the political conjuncture.
Only a correct analysis of the political conjuncture, that
is, of the current moment, lets us put forward adequate
slogans of struggle, that is, slogans which can advance the
revolutionary forces.
In Russia, there was a fundamental difference between
the contradiction resolved by the February Revolution
and the contradiction resolved by the October
Revolution, as well as between the methods used to
resolve them. The principle of using different methods to
resolve different contradictions is one which MarxistLeninists
must strictly observe. The dogmatists do not
observe this principle; they do â€¢ not understand that
conditions differ in different kinds of revolutions, and so
do not understand that different methods should be used
to resolve different contradictions; on the contrary, they
invariably adopt what they imagine to be an unalterable
formula and arbitrarily apply it everywhere, which only
causes setbacks to the revolution or makes a sorry mess of
what was originally well done. [Mao, On
Contradiction]ll
5. The Concept of Transition14
In studying the concept of mode of production we say that
it refers to a dynamic structure which continuously tends to
re'produce its conditions of existence. In this part we shall
study the conditions which determine the change from one
mode of production to another.
The material base of the transition from one mode of
production to another according to traditional Marxist
thought, is characterized by a non-correspondence between
the old dominant relations of production which enter into
contradiction with the degree of development reached by the
productive forces. It becomes a question of replacing the old
relations of production by new ones which correspond to the
degree reached by the development of the pr ductive forces.
The growth of the productive forces and the embryonic
rise of new relation of production have a spontaneous and
unpredictable character. The agents of production, by
perfecting the old means of production and creating new
ones, thereby developing the productive forces, do not
realize the social consequences which they produce. Their
thinking, their consciou ne doe not go beyond the
immediate benefit which this proces provide for them.
But the development of the productive forces and the
change produced in the relations of production operate
spontaneou ly only up to a certain limit. When the new
productive forces and the social relations of production
which correspond to them, which have been born within the
old infrastructure, enter into conflict with the old social
relations of production which had dominated them,
spontaneous development is replaced by consciou activity,
by the truggle of the most advanced cla se â€¢ that is by those
which arise from the new relations of production by creating
at the economic, juridico-political and ideological levels
conditions which favor the development of the new relations
of production.
Thus the old relation of production are defended by the
old ruling cJa ses which have at their disposal the state and
all the means of ideological influence over the ma. es. Their
interest is to maintain these relations of production, and
they use whatever methods at their disposal to resist the
advanced social forces which a Â·pire to put an end to the old
forms of property in order to open the way for the full
development of the productive force .
Only through the class truggle-through revolution-is
it possible to destroy the power of the old dominant classes
and the economic con equences of that power.
The revolutionary classes create new power,
revolutionary power; and on thi basis they destroy the
obstacles which prevent the full development of the
productive forces and the new relations of production
corresponding to them. In this way the spontaneou proces
of ocia1 development prepared at the level of the
infra tructure, is replaced by the consciou activity of the
ma es guided by the clas mo t interested in breaking with
the old system.
The economic basis and cause of social revolutions was
explained by Marx in his Preface to a Critique of Political
Economy:
At a certain stage of their development, the material
forces in society come in connic1 wi!h the existing
relation of production or-what i but a legal expression
for the same thing-with the property relations within
which they have been at work before. From the forms of
development of the forces of production these relations
turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of social
revolution. (Our emphasis, M. H.)
Utilizing the concepts of modes of production and of
social formation, we can say that this "transition from one
mode of production to another" always takes place within a
given social formation. Fir t in the complex economic
struoture of the social formation, where various modes of
production of material goods, that is, different relations of
production co-existÂ· one of the relations of production,
until then ubordinant, begin to acquire an increasingly
more important role, to the point that it comes to constitute
the dominant relation of production at the level of the
economic structure. Then, since the juridico-political and
ideological structures of the social formation have not
changed, tending to favor the old, dominant relations of
production, it becomes necessary that the class which
represents the new relations of production take over the
state apparatus in order to change the ideological and
juridico-political conditions which are braking the
development of the .new relations of production.
The conscious and violent process of destruction of the
old relations of production, that is the revolution, is the
general law which characterizes the change of domination of
one social relation of production by another in a given social
formation.
What is particular to the transition from capitalism to
sociali misthatintheheartofcapitalistsociety thatis ina
social formation where capitalist relation of production
dominate, socialist relations of production cannot arise, as
has been the ca e with all previous societie in which new
relations of production were born within the social
formation where other social relations of production
dominated.
For example, in France the change from the feudal mode
of production dominant until that time, to the capitalist
mode of production, in terms of the economic structure
essentially came about before the Revolution of 1789. That
i , not only the productive forces but also capitalist ocial
relations of production alreadyexi ted. From this point, the
Revolution of 1789 a revolution at the juridico-political
level took place after the (spontaneous) revolution on Lhe
economic level. The eizing of power by the bourgeoisie only
served to consolidate and stimulate the productive force
and their corresponding relations of production.
On the other hand if in the very heart of a social
formation dominated by capitalism productive forces are
born and devoloped of an increasingly greater ocial
character that could erve as the basis of sociali t relations of
production, these relations cannot be established without a
revolution which would give political power to the working
class.
Establishing social relations of production does not
simply involve transforming the factories in uch a way that
capital is suppressed and that the workers administer the
enterpri e. If the problem could be reduced to thi , seed of
socialism could arise within a capita.Ii t society, like the case
of the kibbutz in I rael. But ince socialist relations of
production do not refer to only the factories but to the entire
economy of the country-the forms in which different areas
of production must be articulated etc.-they cannot be
born within capitalist society whose law of development
implie preci ely a certain anarchy of social production.
Up to now we have seen that hi. torical maleriali m show
us that determined social relations of production
correspond, to a given degree, in the development of the
productive forces, and how it is, on the basis of these
relations, that given juridico~political and ideological
relations are established. lf the relation of production
change, then sooner or later the other relations change.
But this the is of historical materialism which appear to
establi h a certain order-fir t step, changes in the
infrastructure, second Â·tep, change in the superstructuremust
be critically studied.
To what modes of production is Marx referring when he
asserts this in the Preface to the Critique?
He is referring to the modes of production in which
"bourgeois society" i the "ultimate contradictory form." He
say that with this bourgeoi ociety. or capitalist mode of
production, "the pre-history of mankind comes to an end."
Therefore, if until the establishment of the capitalist mode
of production it is pos ible to say, in general, that the
juridico-political a11d ideological relations only arise to
confirm and support the relations of production which have
ari en spontaneously from the infrastructure, this statement
is no longer valid for the transition from capitalism to
socialism.
The transition from capitalist relations of production to
socialist relations of production does not happen
spontaneously.
In the transition from capitalism to socialism, the juidicopolitical
relatioÂ·ns are the first to be established. The seizure
of political power by the working class or by the working
class and its allies, creates the conditions which permit the
establishment of socialist relations of production and the
new ideological relations which permit the full development
of the productive forces, the necessary basis for the final
establishment of communism: "to each according to his
needs."
Let us see how Engels described this process:
With the seizing of the means of production by ociety,
production of commodities i done away with, and
simultaneously, the mastery of the product over the
producer. Anarchy in social production is replaced by
plan-conforming, conscious organization. The struggle
for individual existence disappears. Then for the first
time man, in a certain sense, is finally marked off from the
rest of the animal kingdom, and emerges from mere
animal conditions of existence into really human ones.
The whole sphere of the conditions of life which environ
man, and which have hitherto ruled man, now comes
under the dominion and control of man who for the first
time becomes the real, conscious lord of nature, because
he has now become master of his own social
organization. The laws of his own social action, hitherto
standing face to face with man as laws of nature foreign
to, and dominating him, will then be used with full
understanding, and so mastered by him. Man's own
social organization, hitherto confronting him as a
necessity imposed by nature and history, now becomes
the result of his own free action. The extraneous objective
forces that have hitherto governed history pass under the
control of man himself. Only from that time will man
himself, with full consciousness, make his own historyonly
from that time will the social causes set in movement
by him have, in the main and in a constantly growing
measure, the results intended by him; ll is lhe ascent of
man from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of
freedom. [Anti-Duhring]
The transition from capitalism to socialism is, therefore, a
transition in which revolutionary political action advances
the relations of production. The spontaneicist deviation of
Marxism does not see the radical difference between the
transition from capitalism to socialism and the other
previous transitions. It applies the same model to all
transitions and remains waiting for the capitalist social
formation to evolve spontaneously towards socialism.
Summary
In this chapter we have studied tbe concepts of mode of
production, social formation, and politica.l conjuncture. We
30
have seen that the first refers to an abstract social totality,
the second to a concrete, historically determined social
totality, and the third to the "current moment" of a social
formation.
Using the concepts of mode of production and of social
formation we have been able to show what is the object of
Marx's Capital. Finally, we have looked at the concept of
transition from one mode of production to another.
Therefore, in this chapter we have defined the following
concepts of the general theory of historical materialism:
mode of produc1ion, social formation, political
conjuncture.
Questions
1. What are the two senses in which the concept mode of
production is used?
2. What does mode of production mean?
3. Why is it important to be able to have a theoretical
concept in order to analyze reality?
4. Why does the concept mode of production refer to an
abstract totality?
5. What does social formation mean?
6. Why can we not use country as a synonym for social
formation?
7. What is the object of Capital?
8. Can we say that Capital has been out-dated?
9. What is a political conjuncture?
10. What is the scientific method to study a political
conjuncture?
11. Why is it important to study a political conjuncture?
12. What do we mean by transition?
13. How do we differentiate the transitions prior to
capitalism from the transition from capitalism to socialism?
Themes for Reflection
I. ls it possible to speak of a social formation dominated
by capitalism if, at the level of the economic structure, it is
not capitalist relations of production that dominate?
2. How does one determine when a mode of production
of material goods and its corresponding relations of
production come to occupy the dominant role in the
economic structure of a social formation?
3. Why is it important to carefully limit the object of
apital?
. 4. Could you make an analysis of the current conjuncture
of your country by applying the method of the y tern of
contradictions?

NOTES
1 Here Marx is referring to pre-capitalist relations in which the
landlord is the owner of the land and the direct producer is only a
possessor. De jure all his surplus labor belongs to the landlord.
2 The concept of a structure in dominance used here was introduced
by Louis Althusser in his article, "On the Materialist Dialectic," in
For Marx. In the introduction to the Spanish editi.on (la
Revolurion Teorica de Marx) we gave the following definition of
this concept: "the structure in dominance defines the Marxist
totality as a complex whole which possesses the unity of an
articulated structure, in which there is one element which plays the
dominant role and others which are subordinated Lo it; a dynamic
unity in which there is an exchange of roles, the economic level
being what determines in the last in Lance the element of the social
structure which will play the dominant role."
3 We think that it is not correct to state, as Poulantzas does in his
book, Political Power and Social Classes, tbat the matrix of the
mode of production is the type of articulation of its different levels.
If, as Poulantzas himself points out, it is the relation of
production (property, real appropriation) whjch determine the
type of articulation of the levels of the mode of production, this
type of articulation is only an effect of that which really constitutes
the matrix of this mode: the relations of production. We think that
Poulantzas' conception constiwtes the trategic nodal point of his
theoretical errors about the concept of ocial classes.
4 In our opinion the serious error which Andre Gunder Frank
makes in his first books an.d articles on Latin America is to believe
that in order to assert the domination of the world capitalist system
it is necessary to deny the existence of any type of precapitalist
relations. The dorrunation of capitalism in relations of exchange is
confused with the domination at the level of relations of
production. This error impedes the correct analysis of social classes
in Latin America.
s The definition of a social formation as a simple combination of
modes of production is given by Poulantzas in his book, Political
Power and Social Classes.

8 Lenin uses the term "social formation" in an undifferentiated
sense both to refer to an abstract social totality (w'hat we have
called "mode of production") and to refer to a concrete social
totality (what we have called "social formation"). Therefore, it i
necessary to determine in what sense Lenin uses the term, whenever
it appears in one of his texts.

12 The concept of "political conjuncture" can refer both to a given
social formation and to the world situation, in which take place
determined relations between systems of social formation . For
example, the world conjuncture which was produced after victory
of the socialist revolution in Russia, etc.
IJ In Lenin' writings from tbe February revolution to the October
revolutiO'n of 1917, we find excellent analyses of the different
conjunctu.res which were arising in that situation and of the new
political slogans wbich had to be put foward in each conjuncture.
14 We want to warn the reader that we consider this section to be
one of the weakest in the book.
